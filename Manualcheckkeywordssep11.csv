"the vehicle has had ongoing issues since it was purchased in june of 2017. the 'shift to park' problem had to be fixed twice, the emergency braking system engages itself for no apparent reason which has almost caused several accidents, the horn does not work when needed in emergency situations, the headlights are so dim it's dangerous, the battery has drained and left my wife stranded 4 times, and the vehicle has a very rough idle and it almost stalls out.  i attempted to work with gm to have them take the car back early (lease) and the request was recently denied.  this is my 3rd acadia and it by far is the most dangerous car i have ever driven.  i am now reading about a fuel pump problem that could cause the vehicle to catch on fire, a driveshaft that may separate while driving, and a faulty braking system that could cause the vehicle to lose all braking capability.  i do not feel safe having my family in this car and i am requesting your assistance to help me work with gm on a resolution.  i entered the date that the vehicle first started to have issues, there have been over 20 incidents over a 2.5 year period causing a safety issue or leaving my wife and children stranded."

"on 11/28/19 at around 5:30-6:00am, while driving on the 5 south freeway near the atlantic ave off ramp, the car swerved to the right on its own.  i could not control the car'it had a mind of its own. the brakes and steering wheel did not respond to me. i don't know what happened. i don't know if the side camera thought the suv was veering into my lane because the rain distorted its view or what but it was very scary. it was as if the car was driving itself even though autopilot was not on. i could not right the car after the initial swerve, it kept on going, heading towards the exit but ended up going over an embankment, heading straight for a tree before turning and sideswiping it and coming to a stop. thank goodness no one was hurt.    it was still dark and it was raining but not pouring.    the freeway was empty. i was in the 3rd lane and there was a black suv right next to me in the lane #2. i did not see it veer into me; we were both going about 70mph in our own lanes. i had both hands on the wheel, no music was playing and autopilot was not on'though navigation on autopilot was activated.    i contacted tesla right away and they texted that the incident team and engineering team were looking into it, downloading the data (i did not have a usb so i don't have any recording of anything). so far, i have not heard back from these tesla teams and my car still has collision damage as the tesla rep i spoke with advised me to wait on the findings and not to contact my insurance company in case they find tesla's at fault. tesla service center did check out my car on 12/2/19 and released it to me, deeming that it was safe to drive. i have not driven the car in the rain while it's dark since.     i've just recently realized that your department investigates these types of incidents and thought i should reach out."

i recently experienced a steering rack failure due to leaking seals on the gear assembly on my certified pre-owned 2017 subaru sti. the power steering failed to operate both in motion on the highway and at slow speeds in a parking lot and local streets.  the loss of power steering assist makes it extremely difficult to safely control and change of direction for the vehicle. based on my experience and that of many others i know in the subaru community this is a common failure point on the last two generations of these cars. i would like to know why subaru continues to ignore this potentially dangerous part failure and has done nothing to help owners like myself when the issue occurs.

"sometimes truck stays in gear after shifting into park. has rolled forward after i exited the vehicle. lane keep assist has misjudged lane & turned the wheels sharply causing unwanted lane change. pre collision warning often sounds alarms & shows visual warnings with no traffic nearby, the system has emergency braking & i'm afraid of it applying brakes when i'm on the interstate. crash detected audible & visual warnings often appear when there has never been a crash. driver's door mirror is not secure, vibrates/rattles when truck is at highway speeds. front & rear differentials make grinding noises & front end jumps, wheels lock up when using 4x4l. does not always shift into 4x4h. vehicle has overheated & stalled while in traffic. pedestrian detection system is non-functional. a man stepped off the sidewalk in front of my truck on monday, jan 06 2020, i was traveling about 15-20 mph. luckily i saw him in time and put the brakes on, when i came to a stop the man was a mere 2"" from the front of my truck & we were both extremely shaken. had i applied the brakes 1 second later the man would be dead. the pedestrian detection system never alerted me to the pedestrian with any type of warning, audible or visual. the system never assisted with emergency braking as a result. the parking & cross traffic sensors rarely work correctly, almost never detect cross traffic when pulling out of a parking spot. i can pull up to a vehicle, with my front license plate touching the receiver bar on the hitch of the vehicle in front of me before the sensors detect the vehicle.   as a disabled veteran i'm more cautious than most, but all of these issues, of which there are more, make this truck a severe hazard, i do not feel safe driving it. dealership refuses to service anymore, has been in shop 5 times, they have witnessed some issues but won't acknowledge them. uploaded list of defects"

"my wife's 2014 escape worked fine in the morning for her to run and do an errand. when she went to start the car it failed to start and i was able to jump it and get it to a local auto zone for a battery replacement. when i was pulling into auto zone i noticed a small catch while turning left and lost power steering for a few seconds. i made note of it mentally but just focused on getting the battery replaced as that seemed to be the underlying issue. now the battery has been replaced and i go to leave and i have absolutely no power steering with a warning stating ""power steering assist fault"" service required. i muscled her car home to recheck my work and  its all good. a day later after researching the issue i throw a hail mary and disconnect the battery for about a minute and then reconnected it and bingo i have steering. my wife later left for shopping and had zero issues until her attempt to leave. she immediately got the error message and had intermittent power steering on her drive home but was able to make it with the use of brute force. i had the transmission and recall addressed about two to three months ago and this car has been a pain since then with needing a jump in cold weather. now this and the outlook of a 2,000 repair when it took a dealership 2 months to do a recall and replace the transmission that was magically ""fried"" i'm hesitant to trust anything ford says but this a huge safety issue that has documented history and needs to be a recall. now i need to find out why its in and out and what to do moving forward. #fordservicesucks"

"after starting my 2019 gmc sierra, i received a number of warnings including:  1. service trailer brake system  2. steering assist is reduced drive with care  3. service esc  4. brake system failure 62 mph top speed  5. check engine light  as i started to drive, i realized i had a very difficult time stopping as i had to press the brake very hard.  i was in a parking lot and only going 5 - 10 mph, but still had difficulty stopping.      i took the vehicle to the dealership.  they investigated the issue and made a software update working directly with gm.  five days after picking my vehicle up, i received a call from the dealership saying that gm does not have a permanent fix for the issue and that i may experience brake failure again.  my vehicle is back at the dealer without a solution or timeframe for repair."
"purchased new, dec 24, 2019. current odometer 645miles. the vehicle was parked for about 15 minutes, when i returned to my truck and turned it on, multiple warning tones began to sound and the dashboard was illuminated with multiple warning lights (abs, traction control, check engine, parking brake) and messages reading: ""brake system failure 62mph top speed,"" 'service trailer brake system,' 'steering assist is reduced drive with care,'  'service esc.' i turned the vehicle off and on multiple times over the course of 20 minutes, exiting the vehicle, locking the doors, unlocking the doors, and starting the process from the beginning. i decided i wouldn't be driving over 62mph as i was only 2 miles from my home, so i decided to back out and drive home with full intentions of calling the dealership in the morning. when i tried to back out i realized that i had almost zero braking power, having to almost stand up on the brake pedal to stop the vehicle without giving it any gas, and turning was difficult (similar to manual steering in a vintage vehicle). i knew driving home would not be safe. i turns the vehicle off and on once more and all the warning messages and lights were no longer there. the check engine light remained on and is still on. i was able to drive home as though nothing happened, but am fearful this will happen while driving down the road, especially while my children are in the car. i have read multiple forums, this is not an isolated incident, with many others experiencing the same exact issue, sometimes while actually driving, in 2019 gmc sierras and chevy silverado's. this is absolutely unacceptable and will result in injuries and deaths if gm does not resolve the issue."
"car has almost 15,000 miles.  it has developed a strange sticking issue in the steering while driving on the highway.  it almost feels like someone is lightly holding onto the wheel as i'm slightly turning and then suddenly let's go.  this causes me to overcorrect to stay in the lane and it becomes a fight to keep the car in between lanes.  it is most apparent when exiting freeway ramps and changing lanes, although it's also apparent on the freeway when small corrections are needed to keep the vehicle in between lanes.  the other symptom is that the car has become difficult to keep in a straight line.  it requires constant light correction of the steering wheel because the car sways between the lines on the freeway lane.  this is incredibly tiresome on a long drive and it has gotten worse over the past 2,000-3,000 miles.  dealer claims nothing is wrong and that it's the lane keep assist doing it's job.  it's not doing it's job if i can't control the vehicle and makes highway tracking unpredictable.  i have turned every assist off and it still does it.  as a comparison, my wife has a 2017 ex accord with 28,000 miles and it doesn't exhibit any of the symptoms that my 2018 does.  because of the lack of support and knowledge by the dealer, we feel our only choice is to trade this car in as this is not only an annoyance, but a safety issue as well."
"my wife was leaving for work and her 2013 ford escape had a steering assist failure light come on on the dash board. the steering was very difficult to drive. she parked it and used my vehicle to get to work. i looked this up and there are no recalls on this except for 2008 -2011 ford escapes. but the problem is continuing through to 2017 from what i read online mileage ranges from 700 and up . ford has no fix for this, they tell you they need to flash the computer and that fixes the issue. but it does not i have read many reports that this wont fix issue and that most people have had to replace the entire rack/pinion gear assembly and the computer portion of it only to have the problem come back again shortly after having new parts installed. i am old enough to remember driving vehicles with out power steering not to big a deal for me, but some people say there steering locks up completely and cant turn wheel. this can be very dangerous on the road and should not be allowed, i do not want to lose my wife in an accident because ford is not fixing the issue. they need a fix for this that will not return in the future. i have tried to duplicate what happened this morning and have been unsuccessful, if i cant then ford cant and there for no fix for the problem. this needs to be resolved before some one looses a loved one."
"when starting vehicle, the power steering assist does not work.  i have to restart the vehicle 1-3 times to get the steering to work.  this has happened aprox. 6 times in the last 3 months.      took vehicle to dealer for repair as vin doesn't qualify for the recall that affects 2013 explorers and the steering gear.  upon inspection the tech found the power steering rack to be faulty.  the steering gear was replaced on 1/8/2020."
"the fca (forward collision avoidance) system does no work as it should. it does not see vehicles or pedestrians directly in front while not in cruise control.  the only time the system alarms is when following a vehicle, which is in the same lane on city streets, and then the target vehicle turns right and creates no hazard.  the fca does not work according to what is mentioned in the owners manual, nor does it operate like it is shown in a youtube video sponsored by hyundai."
"an electrical problem in the epas unit has resulted in the loss of power steering in my 2013 ford f-150.  vehicle has 63,000 miles and has no accidents and has not been subject to abnormal driving conditions.  the problem presented itself when the weather became cold during the fall of 2019.  when outside temperatures dropped below 65 degrees and i started my vehicle i received a ""power steering assist failure"" warning and the vehicle did not have power steering.  testing over a 4 week period as the outside temperature fluctuated between 40-80 degrees allowed me to see the connection to the power steering failure and the outside temperature.  additionally, when the outside temperature was close to, but did not exceed 65 degrees.  i could start my vehicle and drive it around, the heat from the engine would warm the unit enough to allow it to work.  all i needed to do was turn the vehicle off and then back on and the power steering would work.    after reading about all the recalls ford has issued related to their epas unit i believe there is systemic problem with the part.  additionally, this part cannot be serviced and requires a full replacement.  part cost is $1500 plus 2-3 hours of labor.  putting the total cost to repair at $1800 - $1900 in my area."
"while driving home january 11, 2020 at approximately 8:30 pm on a main street thankfully in very little traffic, while proceeding to travel through a traffic controlled intersection at approximately 50 mph the automatic emergency braking system activated.  this is the third time that this has happened to me and if it had been a day/night with normal heavy traffic, the possibility of a rear end collision would have been great.  previously as well as during this occurrence, the driver is forcefully pitched forward but the simultaneous high pitched sound did not occur and i did not notice an icon flashing on the dash as before.  this occurrence did seem to be of longer duration than the previous incident.  these happened on 1/11/2020 with the two previous incidents on 12/02/19 an 12/11/19 respectively."
"my 2012 chevy volt has completely shut off at freeway speeds, and surface streets on over 15 occasions.  the power steering assist goes out, the brake assist goes out and it's very difficult to steer and break the car, i have nearly avoided several accidents, there is no warning that this will occur.the power steering assist goes out, the brake assist goes out and it's very difficult to steer and break the car, i have nearly avoided several accidents, there is no warning that this will occur  once i have attempted to safely pull over the car says engine not available, propulsion power reduced, the car will not turn off and it says waiting to initialize on the screen. i have had it towed to my local chevrolet dealership and paid a diagnostic, they have been unable to determine the cause of the problem and they just reset the car by unplugging the battery and tell me that they cannot replicate the issue.this does not happen while the car is driving on his hybrid battery, it only happens when driving in hybrid mode with the gas motor.  in doing my own research,  i found a recall campaign that describes the exact issue that has been occurring, it even states that the car may not be safe to drive if this occurs.  recall #18v397000. each time i towed my chevy volt to the dealer it sat there for several weeks to a month, they returned it to me and the next day it died in the road.  the car is not safe to drive, the dealer states that they can't diagnose the problem and i fear for my life every time i drive the car because it happens at random."
"on 01-03-2020 at approx 1 pm pst while driving southbound on hwy 5 at 77 miles per hour, i had ""autopilot"" engaged. a few times the radio cut out and all icons appeared on the screen. repeated chiming was audible.  i then tried to disengage ""autopilot"" by turning the steering wheel.  ""autopilot"" would not disengage.  i then applied the brake pedal.  the car slowed down but when i released the brake the car sped back up to the previous speed. ""autopilot"" would not disengage.  the screen rebooted itself and during that time i attempted to disengage the ""autopilot"" which would not disengage.  when the screen came back on after this first reboot it was frozen and would not respond to any input or touch.  ""autopilot"" was still engaged.  the screen then rebooted a second time and when it came back on is when i could only then fully disengage the ""autopilot""."
"after being parked for a few hours in -10 degree weather or colder i lose power steering. when i start the vehicle and attempt to back out of the driveway i am unable to turn the wheel without an incredible amount of effort. a service message appears stating ""power steering assist. drive with care."" this has occurred every time i have left the vehicle in cold weather for longer than an hour or so. each time this has happened i have been fortunate to be able to get the vehicle into a heated garage right away and after a few hours when i start the vehicle the power steering failure has resolved and the steering wheel turns with ease again.this sounds very similar to recall number 16v054000 (15595) on 2/1/16 for the 2015 chevrolet colorado which required the steering gear torque sensor cover assembly be replaced due to a loss or reduction in power steering assist. this is a huge safety concern. i looked up the issue on the internet and there are several complaints with 2016 chevrolet colorado and gmc canyons and many people have had it occur while driving on freeways at high speeds and around icy corners. apparently, it can occur in any weather not just cold weather though my issue has only occurred since the weather dropped below zero."
"while trying to pass a dump truck on the interstate with adaptive cruise on, vehicle slammed on the brakes, and causing the vehicle behind me to slam on theirs to avoid hitting me.. i noticed that there had been a recall for this before in 2015, but i never received any notice of this.. it is a very serious road hazard!!"
"driving in the early morning while it was still dark outside, i was following another car about 5 car lengths back and the automatic high beams came on. the person in the car ahead became annoyed and slammed on his brakes and proceeded to drive 5 mph until i tuned off the road. i turned off the car and headlights to reset the system. the automatic high beam system is supposed to recognize a car in front of you or oncoming headlights and automatically turn off the high beams. i brought the car to advantage honda in manhasset, ny. they said they checked the system and it's working properly"
"my wife drove to work, the car functioned fine.  when she started the car after work the car computers notified her the steering assist system had failed.  she noticed she could barely turn the wheel.  she called me and i asked her to attempt to drive home and i would look  into it.  i discovered that i could do little but take it to the dealership for repairs."

"my vehicles cruse control, lane departure, collision warning and lane assist completely stopped working after being parked (stationary) in my driveway, vehicle has always had problems with front suspension since new and become unstable with braking hard if another driver cut me off having to apply brakes or when applying brakes down hill.. vehicle was taken to deal for front suspension but never fixed after multiple attempts under warranty.. the latest issue with driver safety system is a manufacturers failure as these are features supposedly to prevent accidents and so fourth on public roads and highways. my vehicle is just over 4 years old and maintained and serviced to manufactures specification. in researching thru the web i found honda owners having this same issue with their vehicle.  i believe honda should recall and fix these problems on their vehicles computer / software or sensors for public safety.  part of the weather door window stripping is also deteriorating."
"i want to both report and complain about an incident that happened with me on december 14, 2019.    i was traveling with my wife and two kids from vancouver, wa to my residence [xxx]. i was driving my tesla model 3 (bmx 2571) and the days before the car had a new update installed (that included improvements to wipers using some ai improvements). there was strong rain while driving on the i-5 freeway. the traffic speed was 70 mph. i was in the middle of a huge pack of cars all moving at the ~ 70 mph.     what we encountered was-  a) first wipers got locked (no movement et all), this reduced my visibility to almost zero and struggling to maneuver the car in the high speed traffic to avoid any accident.  b) the car then went in some shutdown mode of display, both confusing me and leaving adrift as to how to handle the situation.    it took both my wife and me some heroic effort to drive avoiding any accident until the car recovered (it was a period of ~30 sec which sounded like eternity for us) from this freeze, shutdown, and reboot. you can verify my claim as i did file a 'bug report' around that time.      when talking of the anomalies, i have also seen that on freeways the autopilot has tried to put brakes all of a sudden in the past, thus creating life threatening situations. at all these occasions, i had filed 'bug reports' to help tesla. however, latest incident is beyond my wildest imagination and concerning with respect to the safety of life while traveling in a tesla car.    best,  [xxx]    information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6).  *tr"

"i own a 2018 tesla model 3 mid-range (non-autopilot, non-self-driving, software update v10.2 - 2019.40.50.7).    i experienced a cruise control related safety defect on my non-self-driving, non- autopilot tesla model 3 several times since 2019.40.2.1 update.    first time it happened at highway speeds.  i was going 60-65mph with no cars in front of me.  i set the cruise control, let my foot off of the accelerator expecting the cruise control to active like it always had in the past. suddenly, instead of maintaining the speed it was set at it, the car slowed down with full regenerative braking to below 50mph while still indicating the set speed on the display.    i have had the car for over a year (purchased in december 2018) and use car with the cruise control more or less daily. the issue never appeared until after the 2019.40.2.1 update. i was away from home when the update was installed, so i didn't actually start experiencing the issue until january 6, 2020 when i resumed my daily commute.    the most recent time it happened, i was actually on my way to the tesla service center in bellevue wa for an unrelated service appointment.   in the this instance, i was turning right onto a four lane, non-divided surface street and accelerating from a stoplight. i remember accelerating to 33mph and seeing the user interface feedback (black circle around the set speed) as i activated cruise control. before i could react, the car had slowed to about 20mph, while the user interface indicated that the cruise control was still active at 33mph.    i was going up a moderate hill at time. the uphill combined with the full regenerative braking effect made me feel unsafe to say the least. i felt fortunate that there were no cars following closely behind me."

"on 1/18/20, i was travelling in my 2016 tesla model s p100d eastward on anderson hill road toward the intersection with purchase street.  the stop light was red.  i was driving 1mi under the speed limit of 35mph.  the outside temperature was around freezing, and a wet snow had begun 5-10min earlier, with minimal accumulation.  i know exactly how fast i was going because i had cruise control on.  i was not on autopilot.  just cruise control.  when the intersection and stop light came into view, i tapped the break to disengage the cruise control, and then depressed the break to slow the car. nothing happened.  the breaks would not engage.  and neither did the regenerative breaking.  i do not feel that i was skidding or sliding.  it simply felt as if the car had no idea i wanted to brake.  it was very very strange.  in those few seconds it became clear to me there was a good chance i would be dead shortly.  as it happens, i was struck broadside by a large suburban travelling northbound on purchase street perhaps 25 miles an hour.  both he and i seem to have emerged relatively unscathed (physically, anyway) thank god.  but i want to know what happened to my  car.  can you please contact tesla and demand all the information from the cars computers - and their computers at hq - so we can find out???  what happened was extremely dangerous, and could have killed both me nd others.  to summarize: brake failure, both manual and degenerative, in 2016 tesla model s caused massive collision with both cars totalled."

the steering assist reduced light and the stable  track light keep coming  on while driving on street and highway
"tesla ""autopilot"" cannot discern object depth or lateral position due to not having a lidar. the system proceeds to treat this as a non-detection to avoid false positives. with lidar properly implemented most tesla ap accidents and deaths to date would not have occurred. cameras, nor radar or ultrasonic are able to mitigate this. the cameras are not true stereo, the radar has too wide a beam or sweep to discern object lateral location without movement, and ultrasonic seems to have a separate flaw yet diagnosed. (see new summon blind spot issues on twitter etc.)"
"on many occasions, the automatic braking system and blind spot detection systems have engaged at inappropriate times. most recently, the automatic braking system engaged when safely merging with proper signaling from the right lane, which was ending, to the next to the left lane when the only vehicle in the vicinity was fully in the left turn lane. there was enough space between our vehicle and the vehicle behind to avoid a rear end collision but the hard braking was unnecessary and could have caused damage or more serious injuries than those sustained by the driver and passenger caused by the seatbelt locking on the collarbone and chest because of the sudden application of brakes. another recent incident was on the freeway when safely changing lanes with proper signaling from the far left lane to the center lane and the blind spot detection system prevented changing lanes when the closest to the right vehicle was in the far right lane, one lane further than attempting to change into. if this had occurred while changing lanes to avoid a collision with debris or another vehicle, it could have caused damage or injuries."
"note: i am not a tesla short seller, i am real owner, driver of tesla for the last 19 + months.  1.sudden acceleration happened many times during autopilot, vehicle doesn't decelerate even when another vehicle is in front, i had to take control from autropilot with this sudden acceleration and i apply brake. this has been many many times at different locations (freeways ~65mph, expressways ~45/50mph speeds). i did not apply any gas pedal/other techniques to increase the speed, but the vehicle suddenly without any intervention speeds up, i was terrified with this and took control from autopilot. contacted tesla earlier regarding this, but their poor customer service, service center did not help much.  2.automatic emergency braking...which is supposed to stop if any objects infront, does not stop. its just the visible clear objects, vehcile does not stop even at lower, higher speeds.  i request nhtsa to kindly take note of these issues with teslas and appreciate your action in this regard."

"power steering assist failure message appeared in gauge console and power steering went out while driving. the issue was not isolated to driving any speed as it would go out at high and low speeds as well as when attempting to pull in or back out of a parking spot. for awhile it would clear by pulling over and powering car off then back on. the message now stays on always and steering car is vey difficult. now it also says an issue with advancetrack as well. my mechanic has told me i need new rack and pinion, tie rods, and an alignment to fix issue.  i see an open investigation and that this is a common problem with many other 2010 ford fusion owners so i wanted to add my voice to this issue as well."

"i have had my vehicle since march of 2019. on approximately 5 separate occasions since then, the automatic emergency braking system has hard braked at inappropriate times. on at least two occasions, it seemed to be reacting to a seam in the highway, running perpendicular to the road (this was in no way a driving hazard, just a line in the pavement). i would have been traveling around 65mph on the highway on these occasions. on at least two other occasions, i have been 2-3 car lengths behind the next car in front of me, traveling at a similar rate of speed to them, and they slowed to turn. here again, my vehicle inappropriately hard braked as though i was about to hit them, when there was in fact no danger of that (and at least one of these times i was already lightly and appropriately applying the brake myself). in each of these instances i was traveling around 35mph in the city. thankfully these incidents have not led to an accident for me to date, but they are very jarring and could easily have led to someone slamming into the back of my vehicle at a high rate of speed due to the sudden and inappropriate braking. i am glad my car offers this feature, but am strongly considering disabling it due to safety concerns around the malfunctioning."

"i was almost in a rollover accident on oct 7, 2019. i was travelling on state highways from auburn, pa to hershey, pa at apprx 930am. roads were damp/wet but rain had stopped. since i purchased my vehicle, i had always engaged all safety features including lane keep assist (lka), collision alerts, etc. this was main reason i upgraded from my 2014 equinox. on rt 183, heading up a winding mountain road, i almost lost control several times, despite driving well under speed limit. **note: my bf and i had previously complained to dealer, and even had it in for service, bc we both felt car pulled to the right on its own. we are both extremely safe, experienced, non-distracted drivers and thought something was quite odd/off. dealer found nothing. closer to hershey, i was coming around a bend in the road on i believe rt 743 when suddenly my car pulled me severely to the right and almost over an embankment, which would have led to a rollover crash and potential serious injury or death. by the grace of god, and great driving, i just missed a stone wall, and my ?1/4 mile swerving skid back and forth ping-ponged me all over the roadway, barely avoiding mailboxes, fences, and a house. luckily oncoming traffic did not appear until i straightened out of my skid. i called the dealer and said ""my car just tried to kill me."" after research, they called me back and said to turn off the lka. i have, and car no longer pulls to the right, ever. i read the manual, and buried around page 254 is a small black box warning that says to disengage lka on wet, curving roads or collisions may occur. really???? people can die, and the warning is buried on page 254??? i have talked to other newer car owners who have had similar experiences in other cars/brands. i think these ""safety features"" are a double edge sword and need further research. i almost died."

the automatic emergency braking system abruptly engages the brakes when there are no objects in front of the vehicle. this has occurred on several occasions while the vehicle was in motion on city streets.
"my car has a front emergency braking system.  this system is located at the front of the car,  in lower grille. the sensor detects when a vehicle in front of you has stopped. as you get closer to the vehicle, if you do not stop, the car will sound a 3-beep alert notifying you to stop. if you still do not stop, the car will apply the brakes and force the car to stop to prevent an accident., i was driving home, when the 3-beep alert sounded, and the dashboard display started flashing red and white lights.  a message on the display stated that a crash was imminent. then the brakes engaged suddenly, and the car almost came to a complete stop in the middle of the street. the brakes engaged so hard and so quickly, that it threw me forward in the seat. at the time, there was no car in front of me coming to a sudden stop and no crash was imminent. nissan is aware of this issue, and there are class action lawsuits, but nissan won't issue a recall. i've taken my car to a nissan dealerships and they won't replace the sensor. the dealer told me my sensor bracket was slightly bent, but the vehile was bought new and never in an accedent i asked if the braket was installed form the factory slightly bent  they said it could  of been?  this doesn't explain what happened. according to the owner's manual, if the sensor bracket was bent it should never of worked from the start??? , if this were the case, there will be a message on the dashboard display indicating the sensor is obstructed or not funtioning, and the front braking system will turn off. this was the 3rd time it has happened . i decided to get another unbiased opinion from a non nissan dealer repair shop.  they ordered a bracket from nissan and showed me that it was not bent that nissan has an issue with the crash sensor and is looking for any way to deny the repair. the shop owner told me to call nssan and have a rep comeout"
vehicle has been observed to undergo unnecessary emergency braking operations during the use of the adaptive cruise control system. the vehicle seems to be sensing something that's not actually present and this causes it to brake rapidly. the problem is not repeatable when driving the same route under similar conditions.    this is an ongoing problem that has been brought up with the honda dealer but as yet remains an unresolved intermittent problem.

"while driving and vehicle in motion, intermittently the following indicator/warning lights come on, stay on, go off, and come back on again without any pattern: the bsd/rcta warning, the auto start stop, hill descent control, accident avoidance/braking, lane assist, and eyesight. one or more warning/indicator light comes on and then sometimes goes off every time i drive. started on january 18th-still happening feb 1, 2020.. happens regardless of road condition (dry, wet), temperature (very cold, warm (40 degrees), or speed (25 mph to 60 mph). this has happened on highway, city, rural roads. the driver touches nothing and does nothing to begin/end these. sometimes the lights stay on and then when trip is ended, vehicle turned off and restarted, the lights remain on. sometimes next time the vehicle is started, the lights are off. the lane assist indicator and auto braking in particular, are of concern. the lane assist comes on (on its own) and is white'then, while driving, it turns green and tries to steer the car off to the right 'the driver has to hold on tight and fight the steering wheel and car. this seems very unsafe. the driver has tried turning off these lights/functions when they just pop up'while driving'but if in heavy traffic, cannot allow for these distractions. if clear/no traffic, driver attempts shutting off these features by pressing the buttons with these icons 'on the center rear view mirror panel or on the lower left panel below dashboard. sometimes this works, sometimes doesn't and they remain on. the unexpected nature of  warning lights going on and off and difficulty controlling the steering wheel are really causing concern. it is like the car is possessed. this is a new vehicle (5 months). dealer contacted for service but told had to wait 3 weeks for appointment. trying not to get in an accident until then..."
"driving at highway speed in the middle lane during heavy rain. suddenly the steering became almost rigid.  fortunately we were able to get to the side of the road without incident. the car had recently been recalled and repaired regarding the bolts on the power steering assist module. obviously there remains an inherent design flaw in the steering assist function, disabling steering capability that could have proven fatal.  the steering module has been replaced but we have lost confidence in the vehicle."
"toyota pre-collision system with pedestrian detection does not appear to work as advertised. the vehicle has been back to the dealership due to the pre-collision system not sending a warning as it should. dealership stated that there would most like cause damage to my vehicle if they attempted to test the system; the the vehicle did not stop as it should, they would not be responsible for the damage they caused. i also contacted toyota directly how said they could not comment and i need to refer to the toyota documentation which i explained show the vehicle sending warnings and stopping well before my vehicle does. the dealership did confirm the sensitivity was turned all the way up, they could not explain why it was not working, but said ""the car is smarter then people so don't worry about it"""
"my 2010 ford fusion sel has lost all power steering due to a failure in the electronic rack and pinion. i started my vehicle and received two warnings on the information screen in the cluster: power steering assist fault, and service advancetrac. i've done research and have been to multiple ford dealerships, and have been told there is nothing they can do other than charge me over two thousand dollars to have my vehicle fixed. yet, the 2011 and 2012 model years had a full recall of the part at no cost. this is unacceptable on ford's behalf and extremely unsafe due to the fact that with the power steering being out, the stability control is also disabled. yes, my vehicle is drive-able but it is definitely not safe and extremely difficult to maneuver at slower speeds. it's an accident and lawsuit waiting to happen, and i do not want to be the unfortunate one to go through such a thing. this needs to be recalled as soon as possible, before any lives are lost or preventable accidents occur."

i have reached out to tesla 3 times to fix a sudden unintended acceleration issue.     11 days after i reported the issue and they told me my car was ok to drive i got into a accident. it took tesla 5 months to give back the reports of the crash in which they said it was my fault.    i have lost trust in the company and have seen that 127 other people have been affected by the same issue according to cnn    please take care of this issue. any tesla owner is a pioneer of a future creation. after the accident they told me autopilot is on beta mode its not perfect yet. they should not allow public to use a hazardous software.    also tesla employees were very negligent. i almost died in this accident with my father and the manager had no idea of my case even after my car was given to me and they said it was ok to drive. i got into a accident 11 days after they ok'd my car    please help as i am frustrated and do not know what to do anymore or who to get to fix my car. i have documentation of addressing sudden intended acceleration to tesla multiple times.    thank you

i started my car up and the warning came on saying power steering assist default.i can not turn the wheel it is very hard to steer.i brought this car used from the ford dealership on 09/24/18.my car was stationary but it could have happen on the highway i am glad it did not at 70 years old i thank god.it is the electric power steering assist in these ford cars and they are dangerous i want my car fixed by ford.
jerking back and forth of steering wheel would occur occasionally until power steering assistance failed. power steering assist fault code would come on every so often . i was driving down the highway while the code came on and didn't notice any difference in steering difficulty until i parked the car and shut the engine off then back on. power steering is completely failing now resulting in increased force to get the car to turn.
"4 messages appeared on digital dash while driving.  service esc, brake system failure 62 mph top speed, service trailer brake system, steering assist reduced.  i had to press brake pedal to the floor with extremely excessive force to get truck to stop.    note that none of the 4 messages state the vehicle will be extremely difficult to stop or shouldn't be driven, but rather the vehicle wouldn't exceed 62 mph.  it should have reduced the speed to much less, maybe 10 to 15 mph.    this failure could have easily resulted in vehicle accident, or even a fatality accident.  i doubt i will ever carry my family in the truck again due to this and i certainly will not allow my children to drive the truck."

"the steering wheel would occasionally shake ~1' in either direction for about 10 seconds while idling for about 2 days; did that 4/5 times each day.  it would stop while driving.  the 3rd day a sensor alarm went off about 60 seconds apart and by the 4th time, it finally said this error message on the screen 'power steering assist fault'.  all of this part occurred while driving on the interstate, getting onto the exit ramp, onto the main road, through the neighborhood and parking into my driveway.  when looking up the code, this was listed for a recall.  1 tech at the dealership said it was a part of the recall.  another tech said it was not after all and i would have to pay for it.  they insisted it was only for a few vehicles yet it is the same exact recall warning listed.  american corporations and government bodies lack common sense while thriving on greed and control.  obviously the exact same parts were used and the exact same recall has been listed, but magically due to greed and poor common sense, i am being told to jump off a cliff.  let's finally take care of what needs to be done and build trust to one another.  there are thousands of comments stating the exact same thing in which ford refuses to fix this.  nhtsa, you are officially on notice to do what is right and necessary and make ford fix this for everyone and not whom they so choose.  tired of the government being blamed for everything?  me too.  so for once do something to truly shove the billion dollar corporations do what they promise to do and stop worrying about a ceo's 7 figure salary and hurting their feelings.  do something productive please and stop waiting for multiple deaths to occur before you have a meeting with a catered lunch and starbucks to discuss your feelings on the matter.  common sense says preventative maintenance works!!!!"

"the 2019 sprinter has a serious problem with the active lane keeping assist feature (""alka"")    a few weeks ago i drove the van from san diego to mammoth mountain (bishop, ca.      i didn't feel the crosswind was a danger but i had two hands on the wheel to be prepared just in case as i had experience issues with the active lane keeping assist feature in the past and it can not be permanently disabled.    a burst of wind hit me and it pushed me onto the right solid white line. i had a fair amount of tarmac outside the line to my right so i wasn't that concerned with my tires being on top of the line but the van had other ideas for me. alka kicked in super hard and corrected me back towards the middle of the road. it scared the crap out of me as the alka hit a lot harder than i had ever experienced before pulling me back towards the oncoming traffic going the other way! i recall my initial reaction as thinking i had impacted an animal or something it ""hit"" so hard.    i went into panic mode as i thought alka was going to push me into a head on collision with oncoming traffic so i instinctively counter steered right to correct away from oncoming traffic. the net result was a violent right (wind), left (alka), right (driver) combo that had me thinking for a second i as about to lose control of the van and flip it. an experience my pilot friends would call having a pucker factor. i managed to control it but if i'm being honest, just barely. i pulled over and took a little break from driving before making sure alka was totally off and continuing on.    i have since learned from the sprinter source internet forum from other drivers that they also have experienced similar issues and that numerous owners of my exact van agree that this system has serious flaws that may cause a serious crash as it can be unpredictable and overreacting.    thank you for looking into this issue."

"this is a known issue. loss of steering assist occurred this past week, 3 times. we took the vehicle in for the recall on this item 5-16-19, when the system was ""reprogrammed"" by the techs at the chevy dealership. we had never experienced this issue. then last week, the issue occurred. there was a temporary loss of power assist on a long right hand turn at 35 mph when a female was driving which caused some concern. then yesterday the steering stopped entirely in a parking lot. i arrived and got in the car and was able to steer but someone of lesser strength could not have. i drove around the parking lot and was headed straight to the dealership, abut 5 miles away. the steering came back on. then halfway to the dealership, what had happened to my wife happened to me at about 40 mph (steering goes out for a second) and the vehicle lurches hard to the right. she was behind me in my vehicle and saw it happen. we were able to get to the dealership. they documented the lack of power steering assist incidents via the computer. my point is that if this was corrected in may 2019, why is it happening again? if you are not expecting the issue, you will be caught off guard and a wreck is potentially unavoidable. what if i had a trailer in tow at 60+ mhp? death could be the result, for the driver or others. if the issue has not been corrected, gm should pull these vehicles off the road and replace them, free of charge."

"honda pilot 2018 with 20,555 miles has a digital display.   car was on adaptive cruise. weather was fine. my speed was approximately 61mph when the speed limit changed to 65mph as hwy became i73. i used + acceleration button on  right hand column 4 touches to increase speed 1 mph per touch to 65mph. car began to rapidly accelerated to 79mph (last digital speed i saw) and i?m sure higher as i  tried to gain control. . my foot had been off pedal  while cruise was on  so i looked and touched the gas peddle with my right foot to see what was happening. pedal  was depressed. at this point i believe i turned off adaptive cruise by the main button on right hand column but car continued to accelerate. i pushed the de acceleration button - many times and car began to slow down uncontrollably fast realizing this i then pressed brake pedal hard and that broke the control of the adaptive cruise and i was able to get the car to the shoulder of the road.    had car towed to dealership. crown honda in greensboro said no code was stored for the incident "

"i have had this vehicle for 18,000 miles now and i have noticed serious issues with the braking system. when i apply the brakes, i have to (almost) completely floor the brake pedal in order for the car to stop. i had a 2015 honda cr-v for three years and it never had any issues like that. in other words, the brake pedal is too soft compared to similar vehicles. this is especially problematic for shorter drivers (like my mother) because she has small feet and she needs to lift her entire foot to transition between the gas/brake pedals, putting her at a slight disadvantage. i contacted the toyota dealership regarding this issue, but they told me that it was normal and couldn't do anything major about it. this is a major safety hazard. i almost ran into a deer one night on a local road because i couldn't stop the car on time. highway braking is also difficult, so i have to maintain extra distance. however, when using dynamic cruise control, the car is able to successfully brake in accordance to the vehicle travelling ahead of me."

"on wednesday 2/12/2020, while driving home, i detected subtle signs of steering control irregularities and attributed it to icy road conditions. the following morning, 2/13/2020, on my drive into work, the steering condition began to appear again and intensified. i was fortunate to have made it to my place of employment and promptly scheduled a service appointment the following day, friday 2/14/2020. when i left work that day, i discovered a complete loss of steering assist to the degree that it would be impossible to safely control the car. the effort to steer to any normal safe degree was compromised and required that i abandon any attempt to drive the vehicle. if the severe intensity manifested itself while driving, the most probable outcome would have been a collison. i had the vehicle towed to my local dealership saturday, 2/15/2020, requested they diagnose the problem, and expressed my anger at a design flaw that is likely to result in someone's death. they called me back later that day and gave me an estimate of near $2,500 to replace the complete steering rack. i discovered through internet searches, active recalls of prior escape body types for a similar failure but none on my year. i also discovered numerous cases in my internet search of the same failure on my year escape. my work commute was primary city driving."

"while driving our 2018 wrangler jl in 20-30 degree temperature the steering assist locked up, causing my wife to drive the vehicle off of the road while in a slow sweeping curve. after a second or two the steering re-engaged as she was trying to steer back onto the road and she suddenly veered back onto the road. a few seconds later it happened again. fortunately nothing was struck and no one was injured. after the vehicle continued to warm up the lockup did not occur again. this was 3 weeks ago. two days ago, while starting out driving in mid 30 degree temperatures the steering again locked up for about a second before reengaging. all instances occurred after the jeep was sitting outside in the cold and started for the first time that day. both events occurred within the first 4-5 minutes of driving at speeds in the 45-50mph range while making turns to the wheel. the big danger here is that if the vehicle is in a turn and the steering goes out, the driver could try and turn hard on the steering wheel to regain control and if the steering assist kicks back in, an oversteer situation could occur causing the vehicle to roll over or cross over into oncoming traffic. fca has already issued a tsb for the possible problem (08-092-18) which i will now contact my local dealer to see if they will investigate."

driving on the road and all of a sudden lost power steering assist
a power steering assist failure lit up on my dash and i lost my power steering completely while i was turning into a parking lot and i almost hit another vehicle. after i shut off the vehicle and turned it back on it was working properly again. the same thing happened as i was on the highway and was very scary. i now have no power steering. i called ford directly as i found out there was a recall on these vehicles for the year pertaining to my vehicle. they notified me that it was vin specific and nothing could be done to help me since my vin didn't fall under the ones affected. the right year and model but not the right vin. unacceptable considering it's the same issue. this was very upsetting considering it is a known issue and my safety and the safety of others around me is at stake. doing some research i've noticed many more people like me with exact same issue and i'm not sure why ford has done nothing to  addressed this. very upset with ford. this vehicle was purchased for a new driver as well. luckily it happened to me and not to her. please address this safety concern before someone is seriously injured.

' the lane is too narrow or wide.  ' the system does not detect at least one lane marking or when lanes merge or  split.  ' you switch the direction indicator on.

"was driving 70mph on the freeway using adaptive cruise control (acc).  no cars ahead of me, several behind.  the car icon on my dash (lights up while using acc) began flashing then my passport (on it's own) slammed on the breaks, forcing my daughter and i into our seatbelts hard, and forced the cars behind to slam on their breaks.  the break warning that usually flashes on the dash when there's a reason to break didn't happen.  it was a close call but everyone avoided a collision.  immediately took to dealership.  they said they'd never heard of that happening but i googled it and the issue pops up several times in online forums and there's a class action lawsuit from 2017 cr-v's from problems with the acc.  waiting to hear what dealership says, but the guy said they'd just take it for a few test drives and see if it happens again.  absolutely do not feel safe driving vehicle now!"
"while traversing a freeway overpass going 60 to 65 mph the truck suddenly lurched to the left. fortunately no immediate traffic on my left. really frightened me.  after much research i discovered that a component (circuit board) of the new ""speed sensitive"" power steering could fail, making the truck think it was going slower and increase the power steering assist, causing the lurch to the left. this was after having the entire front end of the vehicle checked for alignment, faulty or damaged parts, any adjustments out of spec. they found no cause. i don't actually remember the date and have estimated the date below. i eventually solved the problem (after further research indicating that replacing the circuit board sometimes was only a temporary fix. the solution was installing a ""kit"" i found online that completely removed the new speed controlled power assistance.  i probably had 4 or 5 instances of this occurring, and consider myself extremely fortunate not to have an accident or injury. this was the result of extreme vigilance once i had determined what was happening. during my research i found many reports of the problem, many tried fixes that didn't resolve the problem. one man spent $4000 to have the entire front end of his vehicle replaced, only to have the problem recur. what really bothers me is both why this did not result in a recall, and the fact that this happened so frequently and dealers would not recommend an actual fix, but let customers waste a lot of money ""trying to fix"" the problem, leaving this safety hazard in place."
"blind spot collision warning system is malfunctions whenever it rains. vehicle has 3000 miles on it and for the 5th time in 2 months the blind spot system alarm system goes off while driving in the rain. dealerships refusing to look at the problem unless the engine light is on, which it turns off once the sensors dry off  low beam lights are too bright... police have stopped me twice thinking they are high beams.. also oncoming traffic continues to blast there high beams at our vehicle thinking our high beams are on causing a dangerous driving situation.. local dealerships refuse to fix warranty problems because car was not purchsaed from them"
the blind spot assist (bsa) system is malfunctioning and causes intermittent problems to the headlights malfunctioning during driving or dashboard messages flashing while driving.    this problem is widely reported on mercedes e350 4matic cars across multi year models. mercedes is unwilling to share data of this systemic failures. this should be a recall for defective bsa system components
"while driving my vehicle the power steering system reverted to manual steering mode due to an electric power steering system fault related to the torque sensor. the loss of steering assist while driving required higher steering effort at lower speeds, which may increase the risk of an accident.  i took it into a ford dealer to run some diagnostics and they confirmed that it needs a new steering shaft torque sensor.  there was a recall from ford (14s05) for this exact issue that impacted more than 1 million vehicles in north america.  i am told my vehicle is not part of this recall but if it is the same vehicle with the same exact issue, i don't understand how it is not covered by this recall."
"at speeds above 40 mph with both hands and a good grip on the steering wheel i frequently receive the display warning ""keep hands on steering wheel"" and a loud audio warning. the loud warning is not only annoying but startling to everyone in the car. if i take my hands off the wheel the message goes away. if i leave my hands on the wheel and even grip tighter the warning continues until there is a message that the lane keeping assist system will be disabled temporarily. this warning may repeat at 30 second intervals or less. recently while driving on a straight road i experienced the warning six times in less than ninety seconds. changing hand position and giggling the wheel doesn't stop the warning."
"tl* the contact owns a 2011 ford fusion. the contact stated that upon starting the vehicle, the power steering assist warning light illuminated intermittently. the vehicle was restarted and the warning light disappeared. recently the vehicle was started and the power steering failed to operate as designed. the vehicle was taken to several independent mechanics and to (bergstrom ford lincoln of the fox valley, 525 s green bay rd, neenah, wi 54956) and (kayser ford 2303 w beltline hwy, madison, wi 53713) where the contact was informed that the failure was due to a software failure. the contact referenced the failure to nhtsa campaign number: 15v340000 (steering). the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was contacted and informed of the failure. the approximate failure mileage was 145,000."

"
while driving approximately 15 mph and negotiating a turn the power steering stopped work and quit assisting in turning the vehicle. thankfully i was driving and was strong enough to right the vehicle and avoid leaving the road. might have been a different story for my wife. took it to local ford dealer and they claim the power steering gear needs replaced and that this model/year doesn't qualify for any steering related recalls. after some research i found that 2011-2013 explirers have a power steering assist recall. multiple shops claim that this a very common problem with these newer fords. at the tune of 2700 bucks for parts and labor i am hoping a recall can happen because this is clearly a manufacturer's issue with these gears.
dynamic cruise control will randomly stop working all together or just stop seeing the vehicle in front and start to speed up.  i have taken it to the dealer multiple times and every time they say can't reproduce the issue.  see attached alert to my mobile app showing the malfunction.
"my wife was driving our 2011  fusion and the power steering light came on and  the warning light stated to service the power steering immediately . the steering locked down where she could no longer control the car so she pulled over and i had the car towed to the local ford dealer :  stokes hodges ford (1850 jefferson davis hwy  graniteville, sc 29829) at my expense. they checked and confirmed that this power steering recall was applicable to our fusion and would install it.  the service department called me back later in the week and said that they could not replicate the issue and that  the car showed no code therefore they could not install the recall parts. my wife almost had a serious accident because of the power steering issue so she is afraid to drive the car again due to her close call with an accident. i furthermore called the ford motor company office for issues like this and they agreed with the ford dealer and ignored me. the bottom line is that i insist that the recall be installed before we drive the fusion again. . the vehicle was in motion . the problem occurred  while turning on a highway onto another at a stop light.. the recall consists of replacing a steering gear and an electronic steering assist system is what the dealer told me. i brought the car new and was never notified by the ford motor company about this issue. please help as soon as possible  so we can use the car again without being scared . i found this information on the ford motor company recall website :1field service actions: epas steering efforts  thanks [xxx]      information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6).  *tr"
car accelerated on it's own while parking.  jumped over the stop and crashed into a building.  automatic braking system did not stop the car and air bags did not engage. this car has been serviced for braking for no reason and a new transmission has been installed and now this. i believe this is a lemon. love the car but to many problems. no my car insurance premiums will rise or be cancelled.
"was driving in the city about 40mph, and automatic braking system engaged but there was no hazard. no car near by in front, back, or both sides. this happened 2/26/20 around 10am pt    took car to dealership. they claimed the car was dirty on windshield and is the only possible reason. claimed they were not able to recreate the issue"
"recenltly without prior notice of symptoms, my ford 2014 ford focus displayed steering assist fault when attempting to start the car and leave the office. the car lost all power steering. i shut off the engine, and restarted the car. the power steering was restored and i was able to make it home without further issue. the car perfomed fine for the next week. the following week, the car displayed the same fault, but this time the restart trick did not work. i tried many of the supposed fixes discussed on the internet, but none of them worked. i had to have the car towed to the shop as i was unable to drive the car. further investigating on the internet revealed numerous other complaints of this same nature. i reached out to ford customer service, and was hung up on each time. they people at the call center are like robots repeating the same line over and over regardless of my question. then they hung up on me. i was made aware of a service bulletin that was for problems with the steering assembly, but apparently it only applies to a small number of vehicles. ford customer service is a joke, and they refuse to take responsibility for selling a faulty product. i will never buy another ford vehicle. i have been quoted a repair price of $2500 to replace the rack and pinion system, as the component parts are unavailable for purchase."
this is a complaint about the tesla autopilot.  please note that the vin of a random tesla model s has been used to enable me to file this complaint.  here is a freshly uploaded youtube video of some kids fooling around with autopilot and putting many lives at risk.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxglmmmfkua    despite several fatalities and the scathing ntsb report people are still doing dangerous things.  nothing has been done to correct the misconception that autopilot is self driving and that it is safe to rely on it.  this public misconception was deliberately engineered by elon musk.  autopilot should be geofenced so that it is impossible to use it on undivided roads.  driver monitoring should be in place to prevent the kind of stupidity shown in this video.  since it is impossible to undo the widely held belief that autopilot is perfectly safe and indeed safer than a human driver the only solution is to disable tesla autopilot immediately via an over the air update.  the wreckers yards are filled with astonishing numbers of crashed teslas.  https://poctra.com/tesla-for-sale  it is a certainty that many of these tesla crashes were caused by driver distraction i.e. touchscreen and/or autopilot.    i petition nhtsa to demand an immediate recall or disabling of this dangerously misnamed autopilot.  thank you.  keef  
"the car breaks does not get applied intermittently, i had a forward collision. the forward collision avoidance / warning did not work. the incident happened at a busy street with slow moving traffic. this is the 2nd time the break did not get applied, the first time the road ahead was clear."
"no power steering assist. says ""power steering assist fault"" and steering is difficult. vehicle was in motion"
after driving car the previous day with no issue this morning i received a power steering assist fault warning in my driveway now making car unsafe to drive. saw that other fusions had a recall for this issue but mine did not.
"car displays warning of ""power steering assist fault"" and car looses ability to steer. this happens when the car is both stationary and moving. this is a safety issue. this will cause me to wreck with my children in the car."
"when i put my car in reverse from a parked position, the sensor for the power steering electronic steering assist warning light comes on and i struggle to turn the wheel. i have to shut my car off and let it set for about 20 seconds and then i can drive. sometimes it takes me turning off my car twice. it has only happened when i put my car in reverse."
"tl* the contact owns a 2013 ford f-150. the contact stated that while making a left turn at 15 mph, the power steering ceased without warning. the contact took the vehicle to an independent mechanic where the vehicle was diagnosed with power steering assist failure. the contact was also informed that there was a recall for similar vehicle however, the vin tool failed to confirm a recall. the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was notified of the failure and the contact was informed that the vin was not subjected to a recall. the failure mileage was 155,000."
i recently purchased this car from a private party. there is a power steering assist fault displaying on the screen and i have absolutely no power steering. the previous owner informed me of the issue before i purchased the vehicle. and after reading that there was a recall for this issue but not for my model year i would like to know why. any information is appreciated
"after leaving a shopping center on february 29 2020, we pulled out onto a road to head towards home.  we were driving about 45 miles per hour in traffic and received a notification on the screen that said the engine was off, put car in park.  there was also a warning light that came on for the electronic steering assist with an exclamation point.  we were able to coast to the side of the road trying to maneuver through traffic of 4 lanes.  we put the car in park and attempted to start the vehicle.  it would turn over, but not start.  we called toyota roadside assistance and told them what happened and they said it would take about an hour to get to us and tow the vehicle.  after about 15 minutes we decided to attempt to start the vehicle again.  it started, and the vehicle steering warning light came on, but then went off.  we called roadside assistance and told them we were going to attempt to drive to the dealership where we purchased the vehicle which was only a few miles away.  we left the vehicle there to be checked and so far they say nothing has been found but are checking further and testing the vehicle but so far have been unable to duplicate the occurrence.  it only has 300 miles on the odometer."
"upon starting the vehicle, electronic power steering is unresponsive/inoperable  with corresponding chime and a red steering wheel warning is illuminated on dashboard. seconds to minutes later the power steering will become responsive and red steering wheel indication is cleared or at times a yellow steering wheel will remain. after regaining power steering there is a sudden 'jerk' and it is extremely loose at all speeds. this is remedied with either recycling power multiple times or periodically when an unspecified amount of time passes . this discrepancy happens when vehicle is parked and has been continued over the past two years. it is suspected to steering assist control module or rack and pinion."
"this incident occurred 4-5 times over the last week driving between 25-40 mph. while driving, a warning or notification pops up on the dashboard screen stating stabilitrack off or steering assist off, which stiffens the steering wheel and i can't turn the truck at all. at one point, the notifications popped up and then my a/c went off and radio went off along with my entire vehicle. i had to slam on my brakes, place the vehicle in park, and then restart at which point it came back on and worked until i could pull over and assess what had occurred. i attempted to call gmc customer service (800-996-9463) and advise them of the problem and they acknowledged a recall (#17276 - loss of steering assist), but it didn't apply to my vin#. it only applied to 2014 models of both chevrolet silverado ld and gmc sierra ld vehicles, whereas my vehicle is a 2014 gmc sierra ltd. they advised that a gmc dealer could ""reprogram the eps module software"", but the cost would come out of my pocket and they wouldn't acknowledge any fault or recall issue. my concern is obviously the fact i have kids and transport them to and from school and sporting events. i couldn't even imagine this happening with children in the vehicle and causing an accident or worse injuries to passengers or the driver. this is a major safety issue, and i'm surprised this hasn't been addressed or acknowledged by gmc."
"adaptive cruise control when on closest setting will not stop the car when you are going over 60mph, when a car drastically slows down in front of you the car fails to respond in fact the adaptive cruise control shuts off and ive practically hit the vehicle in front of me many times ..its hard to trust this system..and the other day it just shut off all together without a hard warning i could have plowed into the car in front of me.    also the lane assist does not beep/or seat rattle  when you veer from your lane. it beeps randomly sometimes when you edge out of your lane going around a bend ""sometimes"" but randomly and not consistently. ive talked to chevys customer care team and they keep referring to the dealership like they are the manufacturer..but they did not design and are assuming its working right because all their other same models do the same things..in my opinion this doesnt mean its not a recallable inherent issue with its current programming..i think it is and should be corrected before someone gets hurt"
i was on a highway in warren oh driving to work traveling at 65 mph in the left lane.  a message appeared and said loss of engine power and the at went from 65 to 20 in 1 second. there were vehicles behind me and beside me. i was almost rear ended and when i tried to get over to the side of the road i was almost smashed by a semi. as well as that message it then stated steering assist inactive so it was then hard to turn my wheel as if there wasn't enough of a problem. thank god i am ok but someone else may not be so lucky. there are numerous complaints that i see on the internet about this issue. how is there not a recall. gm should be responsible for these repairs. i just purchased this vehicle in nov 2019.

"while driving normally with no traffic or obstacles in front, all honda sensing suite features randomly fail and trigger a series of warning messages flashing sequentially on the hud indicating a problem with the following: lkas, collision mitigation, braking, adaptive cruise control, and road departure mitigation systems. the brake pedal becomes stiff and brakes feel unresponsive but sometimes engage to stop the car even if stopping is unsafe, such as driving on a highway with no cars in front. this happens randomly in different environments at different speeds. rain, sun, hills, traffic, no traffic, but it is difficult to replicate the issue. the sensors trigger a false positive thinking there is an imminent collision even if driving 35 mph on an empty road. it also triggers when following a car with warning tones and automatic braking. the car feels like it is rebooting itself in the middle of a false but self-induced crisis. i have narrowly avoided collisions because the car took over control when not needed, only to turn off all safety features and warn that there is a problem with the braking system. the dealership service department claimed it was a low battery, but replacing with a new battery does not resolve the issues. the service department then tried to claim driver error after deleting trouble codes, with no explanation how ""driver error"" can cause the same error messages to display on the hud as all of the plaintiffs of a class-action lawsuit say the same thing."

"new purchase 02-29-2020; the mercedes sprinter 2500 that was upfitted by airstream into the airstream interstate nineteen. i drove about 60 miles and when backing from a parking spot i felt a sudden grab/jolt from the right front undercarriage as if backed over a dog/child. thankfully nothing. three more times this occurred over two days but w/o finding a cause i chose to drive 800 miles to seattle from california via i-5. about 40 miles enroute i was going 70 mph on a straight, slight downgrade stretch when the vehicle suddenly grabbed to the right with a short/abrupt jerk on the steering wheel.  this was the same as the backward but now forward and frightening. fortunately i had both hands on the wheel with a firm grip due to the unfamiliar dark roadway and downgrade stretch.  this occurred five other times over the next 70-100 miles at a reduced speed of 40-50 with a firm grip on the wheel and expecting it so i stayed in the far left lane to avoid going off the roadway on the right. the following day i resumed the drive at about 40-50 mph and felt the same grab intermittently.  i called mercedes roadside assist through the vehicles electronic connections on the nav/media screen and they prompted me through deactivating the brake assist.  i deactivated all the other sensor devices like lane assist, parktronics etc that i could find to be as sure as possible it was not going to occur again while driving.  these electronic systems reactivate each time you turn the ignition off so i had to remember to do that prior to driving each time i stopped.  i drove the 800 miles home w/o the sensors active and the problem did not recur.  airstream's upfit makes it less stable and the weight now about 10,000-13-000 pounds very dangerous. if cruise control was engaged much more of a problem or winding roads. i'm a retired commercial pilot and it scared me; needs investigated soon."
my daughter in law was driving the vehicle when the power steering assist fault came on the screen and steering became very hard. she was driving in town around 30 mph and was able to pull over and stop the vehicle. when she restarted it the fault was gone and she was able to drive home. i found that there were many cases of this happening  on the internet at speeds from slow to fast. i  took the vehicle to the local dealer who told me the steering gear had to be replaced. he also said there was no recall on my ford even though several complaints were on the web. they are ordering the part for it and the parts and labor are over 2000$. will ford wait til somebody gets killed before they recall the vehicles?

"metal plates in the road trigger the the car's front-assist sensor to activate the autonomous emergency braking system in the vehicle, despite the absence of any obstruction. the result is a jarring deceleration from ~20mph to a complete stop in a matter of feet: effectively minor accident. there is no advanced warning, only a simultaneous buzzer and dashboard signal. it poses a significant risk to all vehicle occupants, especially passengers who are unaware of the hazard or otherwise unable to prepare themselves (e.g. infants). this problem is persistent, disruptive, and dangerous for the vehicle's occupants as well as any trailing vehicles that may consequently crash into the unexpectedly halted vehicle.    volkswagen claims that this is ""expected behavior"" of the sensor, as the vehicle manual warns of ""unwanted"" behavior when ""there are ...metal plates in the road."" nevertheless, while it may be ""expected,"" it is still patently unsafe. volkswagen's suggested resolution is to permanently disengage the front-assist safety feature of the vehicle. this is unacceptable because it exposes the vehicle's occupants to other safety hazards that might otherwise be avoided with an engaged front-assist system. furthermore, the system must be disengaged anew on each vehicle restart, which leaves room for potential operator oversight.    i experienced this unsafe behavior nearly daily for almost 18 months due to construction in my neighborhood, and i have documented it 3 times with timestamped videos. as this site does not permit video files to be uploaded, i can provide those upon request. a bbb auto line case was opened again volkswagen. vehicle repurchase was denied based on volkswagen's warning of ""unwanted"" behavior in the vehicle manual. nevertheless, the decision affirmed that ""the front assist issue substantially impairs the use, value and safety of the vehicle."""

while driving in a city street  at approximately 20 mph i had my window wipers on due to some pollen on my windshield. while window wipers were engaged  i approach a downward hill  and hit noting but sun glare blinding me i put my brakes on but by that time my suv slammed into the car in front of me. the emergency braking system did not activate
when i started my car the other morning the power steering assist fault message came on.  no power steering.  have read reports of a recall for this?  when i searched my car by vin number it did not show as a recall.  is there a recall on this issue or not?
"two weeks ago i noticed after starting the car i didn't have any power steering for few seconds, then it worked fine. a week ago when i went to start it , i had no power steering and the power steering assist fault lit up on the dash. i turned the car off and restarted, and everything was fine, no fault light and steering worked fine. it did this couple more days until march 13, 2020, no power steering at all, not even after restarting. i'm very lucky this didn't happen when driving. i'm sure there would have been an accident. i took it to reineke ford in findlay, oh, and they said it needs a whole new steering rack, and my car is not covered in the recall since my vin didn't match the one's they are covering. my vin shows my car was made in mexico. i don't understand how ford can cover some 2011s, but not mine that has the exact same issue. i hope my care will be included in the recall soon. it cost me $1,800 to fix. if you are reading this and you have the same problem, please file a complaint."
"the vehicle was started and an error code appeared on dash""steering assist fault service required"".the steering wheel would only move using extreme force rendering the vehicle none operational. the vehicle was parked when this occurred. the vehicle was turned off and then restarted and the code disappeared and the vehicle was driven home. an internet search was conducted and this appears to be a common problem with this vehicle which could render it unsteerable while driving. this has me concerned for my wife and grand children's safety as this is her main mode of transportation. please refer to complaint no. 11292425"

"the lane keeping driving assistance/driving assistance pro on the 2020 bmw 840i gran coupe produces a sudden loud ""bark"" when the assistance system loses sight of the lane markers. that often happens in intersections but can happen anywhere where the lane markers are worn. i bought the car on 2/29/2020 and it has happened many times since then and not only on the date shown. the sudden loud ""bark"" is a distraction, a nuisance and totally unnecessary since the instrument panel also has a large display showing the status of the driving assistance system and the driver is supposed to have the hands on the steering wheel anyway. when driving a car, any distraction is a traffic safety issue, more so when it happens in intersections. i have taken the car to the bmw dealer shop (where i bought the car) but they say that the loud 'bark' cannot be turned off. my request to nhtsa is to disallow bmw and other brands to use systems that produce sudden distracting sounds when the car is in motion.  a lane keeping assist should be a system that improves traffic safety and not one that reduces it due to sudden and unexpected 'barks' that are major distractions."

a large crack formed on the driver side at eye level. i've never seen a windshield break so suddenly and abruptly while driving. it distracted me for about 10 seconds as i was watching the crack get larger. i was driving at 50 miles per hour on the adaptive cruise control. the cruise control lost visibility and turned off immediately. from my understanding the windshields are made to meet the minimum requirements to save costs. subaru does not cover windshields and the eye sight calibration is way too expensive for me to take on personally. a company whose reputation is built on safety should not be cutting corners on the windshields.

"the car's overall electronic reliability and safety are huge areas of concern.    rearview camera and sensors do not always work. sometimes it will operate while car is in motion but it will black out which ultimately impairs the driver's ability to reverse and avoid any objects and pedestrians. this is potentially dangerous in high-foot traffic area like shopping mall.     in addition, the car's lane assistance mechanism is not accurate at times and could have caused accidents several times. for example, the sensor sometimes will mis-detect the lanes and wrongly drift the car out of lanes, almost causing collision with oncoming cars or adjacent cars.    moreover, the audi sensor which detects object and brakes for the driver doesn't work too well. for instance, when making a left turn at an intersection, it will mis-calculate the oncoming traffic and will brake and stall the car in the middle of intersection. also, the audi sensor wrongly detects the object around the car such as elevated sidewalk curbs or fire hydrants and it randomly auto-slam the brakes even while the car is moving at 30-40mph.    the car was in the dealership repair shop at least 5 times to attempt to fix the issue. the dealership replaced the ""mod box"" twice, which seem to fix most of the sensor related issues but issues still arise and i am skeptical and afraid of driving this car.  *tr"

"power steering assist failure. my power steering has failed several other times in the past 6 months before the noted date of this complaint (06/21/2020). the remedy always was the same, turn off the vehicle and restart it. this time it has failed for good. since ford does not have an active recall for my vin number i am forced to pay out of pocket to replace a faulty part. i have scoured the web and seen numerous complaints by others ford owners about this same issue. they more or less say the same thing ""nobody can help us"". i believe that ford has cherry picked which vehicles they wanted to issue a recall for, in order to do the bare minimum. please help.    your time and consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.    thank you  [xxx]    information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6). *cc  *tr"
"i own a 2012 ford explorer. recently i received a warning on the dashboard indicating that there is a ""power steering assist fault. "" this happened while i was driving the vehicle with my family (lucky at a low speed). i am aware of a recall for this issue. in short, the recall covers 2011-2013 explorers and mandates that ford replace first the software for the steering rack assembly and if that does not rectify the problem then the entire steering rack assemble itself.  i visited my local ford dealer who diagnosed the issue and stated that the entire steering rack assemble failed and needed to be replaced. they also informed me that my vehicle is not covered under the recall.  my question is why? a known steering issue for 2012 explorers is clearly evident on my vehicle. seems ford is passing the blame for a known issue!  i must note that there are only 45,000 miles on this vehicle and for this to fail with so few miles (while i was driving) is unacceptable. it is unclear to me why ford would not cover this under the recall especially since it is a major safety issue.    nhtsa campaign number: 14v286000    *tr"

"i own a 2017 honda crv exl model. recently, the sensing device in the front of the car (below the honda logo) got stolen from my car. this safety sensor assists the driver with features such as lane keeping assistance, land departure warning, automatic cruise control, etc.    i know at least 5 more owners from my apartment community whose car's sensor was stolen. all of us have filed a police complain for theft.    the problem why i am asking for assistance is that the sensor can be so easily stolen that even if i get it fixed, there is a high probability that the sensor can get stolen again. one does not need any tool is steal the sensor. anyone can open that panel in a minute and walk away with  an important safety feature. it's that easy. none of us heard any anti theft alarm buzzing when the sensor was stolen.    this is a serious design flaw and honda should take complete responsibility of this debacle and that a permanent solution should be worked out by honda so that the owners do not face the issue in the future.  *tr"

1. car flashes brake and sometimes brakes on its own when it detects an object along the side of the road or when a car may be approaching in the opposite lane or in a center turning lane.  this has nearly caused an accident on two different occasions.  each time the lane we are in is clear and usually doesn't even have a vehicle in front of us.    2. when in cruise control the acc will detect a vehicle in front of us going maybe 2 mhp slower than our set speed and our car will abruptly slow down to about 10 mph below the acc set point.  then it detects there is clear distance to the vehicle in front and will abruptly accelerate till it again detects the vehicle and then repeats the same actions - abrupt slowdown - abrupt acceleration and so on vs. a gradual slowdown to match the vehicle in front speed and holding steady at that speed.  i have set the distance detection to each setting and it makes no difference.    3. lane keep assist is plain down dangerous. tried to merge onto a busy  highway with turn signal on and the lka would not let us merge and jerked the wheel back to the right and the vehicle abruptly hit the brakes when there was nothing in front of us.  nearly caused traffic behind to rear end  us.  4. hands free cell feature is not hands free if connected to apply car play.  this was not what we were lead to believe at the time of sale.  honda has some serious issues with the honda sensing and a recall is a must as these issues will eventually cause an accident and i have to assume already have.  to date the car is unsafe with the sensing on and if i turn it off i risk liability with my insurance as they provide discounts because of the honda sensing safety features.
while driving at any speed  the service power steering drive with care warning comes on and i immediately lose control of steering assist pulling the steering from my hands. seconds later a service stabilitrak warning comes on. i can pull over and turn the truck off and the power steering returns when started. it can continue working for a few minutes or a few days there's no pattern to its malfunction. the recall date is january 6 2015 to march 19 2015 and my truck was manufactured in april 2015 so my truck doesn't come up in the recall. but i feel they not only made a mistake in the manufacturing causing the recall but they made a mistake in the recall window and it should be extended beyond march 19th. i have taken my truck to a dealer and they have diagnosed the problem as intermittent steering gear failure and are charging me $2339.00 to fix what i believe should be part of gms recall. i have attached photos of the dash warnings and the speed that it happened. this malfunction is extremely dangerous when it happens in a turn.
"on april 16, 2019, i attempted to drive my vehicle and pull out in reverse from my garage, however, the touch screen display unit (mcu) would not turn on resulting in an inability to view the rear view camera. it is very risky to drive this vehicle without the mcu. it is also what displays if there are failures in other parts of the vehicle. tesla service towed it to their facility and they ultimately concluded that the unit would still power on but it ultimately was stuck in a boot loop. even though i had the vehicle for less than 4 years, it was out of warranty because of mileage overage, rather than time. tesla refused to cover it under warranty and forced me to pay for it out of pocket for over $2500. this failure is widely known in the tesla community and by tesla itself as service employees acknowledged the defect. it is a result of the emmc nand flash memory failure that degraded quicker than tesla planned after the introduction of auto-pilot. when i purchased and took delivery of the vehicle, it did not have autopilot. the fact that they did not fix this put myself and my family at risk.  *tr"

"lane monitoring system provides inconsistent warnings.  this has been noted when the vehicle is in motion while i drive through the city and also on the highways.  it sometimes without warning adjusts the steering of the vehicle.    brake monitoring system, when it does provide warning, provides warnings so late that a collision would be unavoidable.    tire pressure monitoring system does not provide adequate information to allow for an appropriate response of the driver.  no feedback from the calibration mode of the tpms.  once the system provides its first alarm, doesn't respond well to calibration.  my system now alarms about every 60-100 miles.    the adaptive cruise control is scary.  while it is expected that in especially hilly terrain that the cruise control would vary a bit (a couple of mph either direction), the system sometimes does not engage, sometimes turns itself off without warning, provides inconsistent warning of when the vehicle interval is not maintained, but the biggest problem is that it does not maintain the set point.  for example yesterday, acc set at 42 mph.  speed limit was 40 mph.  i was descending a hill and manually disengaged the acc when the vehicle speed exceeded 57 mph.  same trip -- acc set at 67 mph, speed limit at 65 mph; acc disengaged manually when vehicle speed approached 76 mph.  third instance, acc set at 56 mph, speed limit was 55 mph, acc manually disengaged at 63 mph.  when acc first engaged, speed is at the set point.  then the system can't maintain the speed and consistently runs 1-2 mph below the set point.  hence, me setting the acc 1-2 mph above the speed limit.    believe that these are all part of the honda sensing system which was part of the touring package, which is what i have.  the 2017 cr-v models with the same system have a pending class action lawsuit.  honda will not respond to our inquiries."

"it started with the truck losing power when making slow speed turns into driveway/parking spot which includes loss of power steering which has caused me to almost crash several times.  the power used to come back up but now it is resulting in the truck just turning itself off mid turn and not just on slow turns. it happened when i was making a turn onto a street and i was forced to muscle the truck off the side of the road- no power at all so no power steering-going about 10-15 mph. when driving with cruise control on if you use the turn signal it kicks off the cruise control.  the ac will just stop and the truck will just shut off.  the whole time all/any of this is happening my dash is telling me stability control is off, steering assist of off drive with care....if the dash has any power that is.  the trailer brake system flashes like i am using the brakes when i am sitting in the truck door open, key out. i have unplugged that thinking it was the problem but it didn't change anything.  at times it is completely random that all power almost bottoms out and comes back moments later.  there is definitely something wrong and as see i am not the only one having these same issues...should investigate and offer recall and get these trucks fixed before someone does crash. my truck only has 53,300 miles on it and it has a new battery and we have checked the alternator. the date below would be when i almost crashed turning the corner and truck died."

"this involves a 2019 chrysler pacifica plug-in hybrid. while traveling at 80 mph with dynamic cruise control engaged, the vehicle suddenly lost all propulsion. the internal combustion engine was off, and no power came from the electric motor. the air conditioning also turned off. despite pressing the accelerator, there was no power at all. the vehicle was only coasting, and lost speed rapidly. despite losing propulsion, i never felt like i lost brakes or steering. despite this, i felt very unsafe as i was traveling at highway speed in the middle of an interstate when this occurred. the display alternated between two messages. one stated i needed to shift to 'p' and press the start button (the vehicle was still in motion). the second message stated there was a fault in the hybrid charging system. once stopped on the shoulder, i shifted to park and pressed the start button while pressing the brake pedal (the normal process to start the vehicle). the dashboard, infotainment system, and window control appeared to power-cycle, but neither the vehicle nor the air conditioning would start. the dashboard continued to display a message saying a charging system failure had occurred. after 45 minutes of repeatedly trying to start the car by pressing the brake and pushing the start button. i tried just pressing the start button without pressing the brake. the car shut all the way off, and after waiting a moment, i was able to start the car by pressing the brake and then pushing the start button. once started, the vehicle then ran normally except for a check engine light. five days prior to this incident, a chrysler dealer performed the repair for recall nhtsa 19v-886, and the initial inspection for recall nhtsa 20v-334."
power steering has started to turn hard at times when turning corners. it will turn a little bit fine and then become extremely hard to turn for about 6 inches on the steering wheel. it will do this 3 times or so depending on how sharp you try to turn. it happen a couple times last month then went away and drove fine. today it started again. i wasn't sure i was going to get turned. it has not gone away as of now. i just went out and checked. we stationary you can feel it grabbing a little. while driving in the city it can be very tough to turn. i haven't tried to make any sharp turns at highway speeds but after exiting the interstate on an exit ramp with a curve. after turning the wheel a few inches i can feel more tension than normal. i believe this to be a faulty electronic power steering assist that i see there is a recall on but not on my truck.

the steering assist failed and warning messages appeared on the console for both the steering assist and the stabiltract system.  i head the truck towed to the new smyrna beach chevrolet dealer to have their 'trained mechanics repair the failure.  two days later after having called the service rep and the service manager asking for a return call with the status and getting no such calls i was finally able to elicit the cashiers help in determining the status of my truck.   so i paid a $200 diagnostic fee and was told i needed a new battery to fix the steering failure.  i bought their $150 battery with the assurances that all is back in working order.   i drive the truck about 1/4 mile down the road and the steering assist quit again.   not only is chevrolet allowing this dangerous malfunction to continue but their allowing this scam of $200 diagnostic fee and telling customers they need a new $150 battery which doesn't have anything to do with the steering failure.  i'm buying a ford or dodge as soon as i can.   no more chevrolet for me.

"on a sunny, clear, dry day and on a paved and marked two lane country road, the car would not let me turn to the right on a swtichback turn.  i was travelling at approximately 25 -30 mph with my foot lightly on the accelerator to maintain speed.  the switchback was to the right and upward and it was around 14:00.  basically the steering wheel locked and remained locked forcing the car into the opposite lane of traffic until i brought the car to a full stop at which point the steering wheel unlocked and i could turn the vehicle to the right and follow the road back to the right on its course.  the elapsed time was probably 3-4 seconds and fortunately there was no oncoming traffic or vehicles behind us.  the lane departure warning system was on.  the ""main"" button for the adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist was on but neither of these systems were engaged.  the sensors and camera on the front did not have anything blocking them other than what you might expect after driving a car in normal driving conditions without a wash for 4-5 days. the problem has not re-occurred since this one time event but we also have not driven the car on switchback roads since and don't normally do so. the car had approximately 1500 miles on it.   there was no damage to the car and nothing to show so there are no pictures included with this report.  i have reported this issue to honda directly as well.  i"

"during normal driving conditions in the city i live in, my power steering suddenly went out. at first i thought that my engine had stalled, but then i realized the motor was still on. my ford focus suddenly lost it power steering function while i was driving it. (very scary) an engine warning light was displaying (steering assist). i drove home to see if i could read up in the internet to see if i could self diagnosis the problem. some video indicated it was a fuse.

i've had scary problems with brake assist and lane assist.  with lane assist the vehicle has made sudden violent turns to stay in a lane.  sometimes if there's a gap in the road lines (such as a turn lane) lane assist can be unpredictable.  adaptive cruise control works fine but i've had several instances when traffic ahead stopped abruptly where it wouldn't have stopped in time to avoid a collision.

"on july 25, 2020, when driving down the interstate, using google maps gps for direction on apple carplay, the display all of a sudden started beeping and flashing different screens. the screen brightness changed as well as the display. nothing was being touched. this went on for at least 4 minutes until we had to pull over and shut the car off in order to stop the beeping and screen flashing. the passenger has a video of the screen flashing/beeping and proof that no buttons were being touched that we can share. it was extremely distracting and was very dangerous. i believe this incident also re-set the lane keep assist and automatic cruise control notification settings.     on wednesday, august 7, 2020, the incident occurred again driving on a different interstate when using apple carplay for google maps gps. the brightness indicator flashes, the screen changes brightness, and changes screens without prompting. there is no way to stop it unless the car is pulled over and turned off."

"this complaint is about tesla's first generation media control unit  (mcu). the mcu is the brains of the car and control the big center screen that the tesla model s is known for. when it failed not only did i lose the ability to use this big screen but i also lost key safety items signals, backup camera, cruise control,  automatic breaking, and auto pilot. all the sound features are also disengaged as well and this was evident in the lack of sound for the turn signal as well as the lack of sound for the alert if your seatbelt is undone. specifically in regards to the turn signal  for example if you put the turn signal down to as if you are turning left the nob will lock into the down position leading you to believe your turn signal is working but unless you are outside the car you have no awareness to the fact that the signals are not blinking.  in addition to this my car lost its control of the air condition and any millage tracking features were lost.  the mcu completely failed on me 3 times. the first two times it came back after a few hours  and the third time it never came back (was driven to the service center after 3 days and it still hadn't come back).  the failed mcu allows you to continue to drive the car and you have no awareness to the safety features that are disengaged.  also, all the sensors are disengaged to me the user which stops the car from alerting me to objects ahead, behind and to either side of me. there are endless articles about the first generation mcu failures. the chips inside these cars are known to fail after a certain numbers of cycles and tesla has yet to address this known issues leaving the consumer to fend for themselves.  please investigate these issues and hold tesla accountable."

"when traveling at 70-75 mph on highway, my engine light came on. the car suddenly started to decelerate until i could only go 25-30 mph (no matter how much i pressed the gas pedal). i had to drive about 5 mins. like this (with my 4-way flashers on), as cars passed around me at high speed, until i could find a suitable place to pull over on the shoulder. once safely on the shoulder and stopped, i shut off the car, waited about 2 minutes, then restarted the car - then everything seemed to be fine. i drove home without incident. the next day i took it to the acura dealer and they acted like it might have been the lane assist tech getting confused by the lines on the highway, or by water puddles. they said that because i shut the car off and restarted it, that any ""codes"" that might help them figure things out were lost. they said next time, do not restart the car but have it towed right to the dealer. i pointed out how inconvenient and unsafe that might be to do! they also said they had heard of no other 2020 acura rdx with this problem. i pointed out that i found a bunch of owners online who has reported this with 2019 rdxs. they conceded that they just didn't know what was going on. finally, i want to note that this car is only 2 weeks old!! i just bought it and this happened :("

"i was driving at appx 30 mph on a city street, upon starting to stop, i hear a loud noise and i lost the ability to steer my car. the bolt that holds the power steering assist motor to the rack and pinion broke and left me with no steering capabilities. ford issued a recall (15s14) for this bolt corrosion problem. it was replaced in 2016, however the same exact problem occurred again and upon inspecting bolt it was determined that it was in fact corroded and cracked 3/4 of the way before the final break. this is a serious safety issue within the fusion line of cars, the recommended ""fix"" action that was taken is not adequate to mitigate this problem from further happening and potentially causing serious consequences to drivers who assume this issue has  been ""fixed"" because they've taken their car in for recall measures. this issue will cause serious damage or loss of life if not remedied by ford immediately.

"the active lane keep assist may work intermittently based on many conditions like weather, road, light, lane marking, etc... when the lane keep assist (active mode) is engaged a green light appears on the dashboard... and when it disengages the green light just turns off... and no sound/beep warning happens... and i believe that it is a design flaw that there would be no beep/sound/alert when the lane keep assist dis engages and you still say that the driver is accountable/responsible. i would consider this flaw as a safety issue.    please note that no incident or accident happened but raising this complaint so this can be reviewed."

"the power steering assist alert came on. we followed the manual suggestion of pulling over, turning off vehicle and restarting and it did not repeat. it also didn't happen again for weeks. today that alert and another power steering warning came on and there is no power steering. we live on a plateau with curvy roads down to any repair center so are fearful of driving now. why does a vehicle with under 60,000 miles even have a section in the manual about what to do about a warning that will most likely cost you $2500 (per ford dealer in springfield tn) and cause a dangerous driving situation? we tried several times today and received the warning each time. we never left the driveway."

power steering assist fault came on i was fortunate that it happened when i was stationary in a driveway and not very far from home. steering is locked and it's incredibly difficult to turn either left or right. i called fords recall # and i was told my car doest fall under recall coverage because the month it was assembled was when they swapped to using another steering rack despite my vehicle having the exact same problem specified under recall 15s18. i'm unsure why they would swap steering racks midway through the '13 model year unless they knew they installed faulty equipment.
i have had the car for years and the power assist fault light has came on numerous times mostly when i first start the car but it has happened while driving as well making it extremely dangerous when you lose steering. usually i can power off and restart and it goes away. this morning i have restarted multiple times and the power steering assist fault will not go away. i have looked up recalls for my vehicle and recall 15s18 explains my exact issue. however the cut off date for vehicles for this recall is 2/28/12 and my vehicle was made 3/12/12. less than 2 weeks between the infected vs my car. ford should have to pay for this as i believe its too close of a date to really know if my car was made with the same parts that were defective 10days before mine

i was getting ready to leave work and i put my car in reverse that's when my power steering assist malfunctioned. it has done that before and i would just put it in park shut it off then restart it and it would be fine. i've talked to my local dealership about getting it fixed because it's a recall only for them to tell me that it's a closed recall. and they didn't tell me that before i brought it in and they're wanting me to pay $77 for the diagnostics test now.  
"while driving or stationary, the power steering assist fails and defaults to manual steering. this has happened on city roads, highways, and stationary. the steering wheel will actually snap back while holding it steering.  the air conditioner fails to work when this happens as well. this has periodically been happening even though the date listed is today. ford was contacted and advised my vehicle wasn't manufactured at the specific plant so it shouldn't have any issues (even though it's experiencing the exact issues as the recall) and recommended i take it to a dealership and pay $1500+ out of pocket to correct the issue."
"i purchased this vehicle from the local nissan dealer in october 2019.  since then, the forward emergency braking system continually turns off within just a few miles of driving the car. this also shuts down the cruise control to the vehicle. i have taken the vehicle back to the nissan dealership several times where i had to pay for them to replace the radar sensor that controls the system. it did not help and the problem occurs still every single time i drive the vehicle. the only way to re-engage the system is to stop the vehicle and turn off the engine and then start the vehicle back up. this is the same system that has caused numerous problems with the nissan rogue. the question below is not for when did this happen, it is more of a case of when hasn't this happened? this vehicle is an absolute lemon and should not be available to the public."

"the emmc flash memory is failing, leading to the main screen blacking out for several minutes both while driving and when at stop and when the car is booting up. this prevents adjustment of several components including climate (fans, defog, ac), manual lighting, cruise control/autopilot, etc.  it has been happening for over a month, progressively getting worse.  tesla is telling us we have to replace the flash memory (~$500, but there is no guarantee the problem won't reoccur), or replace or upgrade the mcu (~$1500-2500). the car was recently upgraded to full self drive hardware (paid for in 2016) and others have reported that this contributes to the memory dying, so we contend this design flaw should be repaired by tesla for free."
i was driving on the capital beltway in silver spring during evening rush hour going approximately 60 mph when the vehicle started to slow down on its own and the warning lights on the dash associated with the emergency braking system ( which causes the car to abruptly stop if you are going to crash) started to flash. it lasted about 5-10 seconds . i did not take my foot off the gas or brake the car. then it accelerated on its own to 60 mph.
"the adaptive cruise control (acc) in the i3 is single camera based, and will deactivate during a number of conditions (such as driving into direct sunlight which blinds the camera.) this is a design limitation, but not the problem. the problem is when acc deactivates, the car immediately goes into full regen braking without warning. at highway speeds this is a sudden and significant deceleration that poses a safety hazard (being rear ended)."

"on 09/05/2020, i encountered the ""steering assist fault - service required"" error message, resulting in loss of power assist to the steering mechanism.     this is the same issue attributed to safety recall# 19s26 pertaining to similar vehicles (ford edge, etc) of this model year. the issue generates from inadequate wax coating on the bolts attaching the steering gear motor, causing it to detach from the housing. this results in loss of power steering capabilities, creating a potential crash hazard if occurring while operating the vehicle on the road.    my vehicle has 37142 miles (very low for the model year) and has always been well maintained as well as driven with great care and attention to prolonging its overall lifespan and general condition. the issue came to pass while the vehicle was stationary, the error message and loss of power steering occurring while parked and starting up said vehicle.    there are many other online complaints of this exact incident relating to this model year and specific vehicle, yet no recall has been issued by the manufacturer. in most instances it appears the consumer is expected to absorb the repair costs, which can run upwards of $2000 - 3000 or more - up to and including rebuilding the entire steering system. this is suspect behavior given the lack of ownership of the root cause from the manufacturer and leads one to believe dealerships may be unfairly profiting from needless repairs given the serious nature of the fault in question."

"steering returnabilty or ""return to center"" is impeded by electric power steering assist. according to ford the new electric over hydraulic system installed on some super duty trucks assists the driver during cross wind or heavy road crown situations. but when there is no wind or road crown the system continues to ""assist"" and holds the steering column from immediately returning to center. this vehicle is not equipped with a ""lane keeping' or ""auto steer"" system.     under certain conditions the vehicle requires constant left and right input to maintain lane.when driving between 30 mph and 50 mph the vehicle will continue to navigate turns after the steering wheel is released.   this constant input is very fatiguing and when road conditions are slippery, icy or rough maintaining lane is extremely difficult at times."

the forward emergency braking is getting false triggers and disables itself after such incident. many times triggers without anything in front of vehicle. has also applied brakes on one occasion when there was no vehicle or pedestrian in front of vehicle. the feb sensor was updated in 2019 with a new part  that does not send false triggers. this is a common problem with muranos from 2015-2018. this safety feature is one of the reasons we bought this car and now that feature is not reliable. i think nissan should supply updated part and let customer pay labor to have this safety feature be more reliable.
"recently i have a message appear on my display screen. while sitting at a red light of course the car shuts off but when the traffic light turns green and the car starts back, i get the message steering assist reduced. i've been seeing this message for a few weeks now. this morning on my way to work, once again the message appears and this time my doors unlocked & locked, the vehicle reduced speed and i drove it at that speed until i was able to merge off the highway. i pulled into a parking lot and turned the car off. i waited a few minutes and restarted the car. i was able to make it to work but constantly put the car in neutral or park when i got to a red traffic light. this really scared me while driving in heavy traffic. several cars had to go around me due to reduced speed. i see several people with the same complaint. got to be a recall. i have an appointment with a chevy dealership on tomorrow and hopefully i'll get some answers. praying whatever the problem is under warranty. i need answers!!!"

"the vehicle has some emergency steering control that is automatically built in. if you go outside of the lanes, it not only steers you back to within the lanes, but also slams on the brakes.  it is automatically on. it can be shifted off every single time you start the vehicle, but it is a default setting. this has proven to be extremely dangerous in approximately 5 situations while driving the vehicle, and i just bought the vehicle four months ago. to illustrate it: we were driving through a construction zone. at times in construction/work zones, the flow of traffic forces you outside of the lines for safety purposes.  however, the van tried to force us back ""into the lines"" multiple times, in construction, at night, with many other vehicles.  it actually forced our vehicle back across the line and into oncoming traffic in multiple scenarios. this is a case of an automatic ""safety"" setting gone wrong.  it is highly, highly dangerous to have it automatically do this, whether it's due to oncoming traffic, same direction traffic, construction obstacles or even swerving to avoid debris or animals.  this lane assist must be disabled to allow for safe operation of this vehicle.*dt *tr"

"adaptive cruise control will fail to turn on. after attempting to turn on, accelerator pedal will have .5-1 second delay when attempting to accelerate from stop/idle causing near collisions.    since purchase, there have been 10-15 episodes where i attempt to turn on adaptive cruise control while on the freeway but the system will not engage. i only get 3 beeps and an ""acc off"" indication on the dash. once this happens, for the rest of that drive, there is a  pedal dead zone/severe acceleration delay when starting from a stop. this delay in acceleration has caused several close calls when pulling out with obstructed views as i press the gas pedal but get no response for what feels like 1 second while another car comes into view and is fast approaching.    once the initial adaptive cruise control failure occurs, acc and traditional cruise control will both fail to start across multiple drives and engine starts. the severe pedal delay will return across engine starts as soon as the acc button is pressed. the only way to recover the functionality of acc and normal cruise control once in this state is to remove power from the battery and wait a minute, then power on the engine and let systems restart.    car has been to dealers close to 10 times for this issue. in consultation with honda techline the following parts have been replaced but problem continues at random intervals: forward looking camera, forward radar sensor, main instrument cluster, pedal sensor, windshield, alternator, battery.    appears to be some kind of software bug in adaptive cruise control system that causes system to crash and not work again until engine computer reset. i'd gladly work directly with honda for troubleshooting, i'm 3-4 people removed when working with the dealership and i feel like all my info is not being communicated correctly."

"i was driving my 2012 ford fusion sel down a street on october 4th 2020 near where i live and this alarm started going off and it alerted me the power steering assist fault and i lost my steering and hit a curb. luckily i didn't do anymore damage or hit someone. i drug it home and had a wrecker pick it up to take it to the nearest ford dealership. they diagnosed it as a faulty steering box or rack and pinion, it all needs to be replaced to the tune of 1868.00. the ford dealership found a recall from 2015 that describes this same issue in 2011-2012 ford fusions but for some reason my vin was not included, maybe by mistake seems how it's the same part that ford knew was causing problems. it's just a good thing that i didn't hit someone and kill them with ford knowing this was a issue with these cars and didn't do anything about it. i hope you will do your do diligence on these issues and fix every one of them before someone does get hurt. trying to fork over 1800 in a time like this is very tough and i hope you can make it right with all involved. thanks for your time.

"similar to nhtsa id# 11290551, i too experienced sudden acceleration of my vehicle over the set speed on the cruise control systems in both medium (35-45mph) and highway (50-65mph) speeds. i'm the original owner of the vehicle, currently under 15k miles. periodic visual inspections by owner, all vehicle maintenance performed by dealership as per owner's manual. while i never let the car take over the driver, it concerns me if this happens with my wife driving it as she may not have the same thinking that i do. aside of that, the adaptive cruise control feature is inconsistent in detecting vehicles while switching lanes or in flat surfaced curves, regardless of the weather (happened multiple times during clear days and under moderate rain).  this causes the vehicle to accelerate so it returns to the set speed. while the feature works ok most of the time, those inconsistencies can cause severe problems on highway speeds - which is the place they are most used at. once again, while i feel i am always in control of my vehicle, i get concerned for my wife. she does not do highways or drives longer than a 10 miles radius to a few known locations by herself. by the few times i experienced the reported, i've considered if the vehicle with the claimed added safety features were worth the purchase and are truly ready for wide adoption."
"i was driving my 2010 ford escape and went to turn a corner and heard a beeping chime and the vehicle became hard to turn.  i was able to pull into a parking spot and turn the car off. when i started it back up and had problems turning out of the spot then it was fine.  i drove it home and when i went to turn into the driveway it started chiming again and  the power steering assist failed came on the dashboard. it won't turn or anything.  i looked it up online and found out this is a common problem that has been going on with the 2010 escapes and there was a recall out on it.  i called ford and gave them my vin number but they said it wasn't covered in the recall.  i took it to my auto repair shop and they told me that the whole steering column has to be replaced.  it's costing me $1,753."

"rapid acceleration - this has happened twice to our subaru. the first incident was about a year ago. my wife was driving and i was the passenger. we drove into our driveway and sat their talking while the garage door opened for a few minutes. her foot was on the brake the entire time. suddenly the outback surged forward at a rapid speed. thank god for subaru emergency accident braking system that stopped the vehicle within inches of our back garage wall.i remember my wife saying ""what just happened? i didn't do anything we were just sitting their my foot on the brake and it just lunged ahead rapidly. i didn't do anything to stop the vehicle other than step on the brake.    rapid acceleration #2 - this happened two weeks ago and i was driving with no passengers. i was pulling into our garage and again the outback rapidly surged ahead. i stood on the brakes to stop and had no response. the eye sight emergency braking system kicked in and stopped the vehicle with a panic stop. i am positive in both cases we were braking the vehicle and our foot was not on the accelerator.    i feel unsafe driving this vehicle. if someone is standing in front of this vehicle when it rapidly accelerates they will be injured or killed and i don't want to ever see this happen. i feel subrau should supply me with a free loaner car until this problem is fixed. i know their is no safety recall issued and the dealer will only replace the control module at customer expense."
"power steering failed completely on my 2016 ford explorer while driving. dashboard lit up with a steering assist fault, and then hill assist fault. steering the vehicle to safety was very challeging. i was turning at a left turn light and almost crashed into another vehicle because i could not steer the car. looked it up online and have found numerous other accounts of the same issue with no repsonse or recall from ford."
"while driving in the left-most lane on mopac expressway in austin (although has happened other times and places as well) with ""full self driving"" autopilot engaged (and with the car having been in control for quite some time before this), the vehicle  slammed on the brakes for no apparent reason. i immedately pressed the accelerator to override the breaking action and avoid being rear ended. to the best of my knowledge no accidents occurred as a result, however it did cause multiple cars behind me to have to brake.    similar issues incidents have happened before, however it seems to be doing it much more often now.    i'm unable to upload it, but i also have a video from the vehicle itself showing the incident."
"vehicle has under 30,000 miles and requires a new power steering module which includes the rack and pinion steering assembly, new computer programming and wheel alignment.  the factory installed power steering assembly module is turning off and back on; when off there is no power steering assistance make if very difficult to steer the car especially at slower speeds.  when the power steering comes back on and the vehicle is at speed it creates a very sensitive steering wheel which causes driver to over steer the vehicle.  when making a sharp turn like when turning onto another street and the power steering is out the driver has to ""muscle"" the steering wheel to make the turn; if during that turn the power steering assist returns this causes the driver to over steer the car either into traffic or off the road.  as of 10/07/2020 the power steering assist is completely out and the vehicle is not safe to drive."
"i've created several bug reports for the autopilot system which is, a very real danger. the vehicle accelerates towards parked or stopped cars, slams on the brakes without explanation on the freeway, begins to change lanes on the freeway then violently swerves back into the original lane without explanation.  i've taken the vehicle into 3 different service centers.  the explanation is ""software"" and they recommend ""updating the software"" when new versions come out.  the version of software released are not ready to be released to the general public.  as a pilot, i understand how autopilot systems should behavior.  the tesla autopilot behaves so dangerously it doesn't appear the software engineers even bothered to test it before release."
when starting the malibu the dashboard lights illuminate and when the key is turned to start the car the lights go out and the fuel gauge drops to zero or empty and the car will not start. this problem also occurs when driving the car and the ignition system shuts down leaving you with no steering assist and the engine is not running. so this problem is both in a standing start and while operating the car. i had initially brought the car to devan lowe gm dealer and service department for repairs and they discovered the fuel pump was not working properly. they replaced the fuel pump and the problem with the ignition is still persisting. this creates a dangerous condition for the driver and other cars on the road. i would request that gmc have the car towed to the devan lowe service department for troubleshooting purposes in coordination with gm technical department and reach a resolution as to the cause of the problem and issue a recall for all affected cars.

"just purchase the auto pilot, when coming to a stop, sometime it pass the white line. while going stright,when signal to change lane to bypass the slow car, it merge into left turn at the stop light. when the vheicle is going around a left corner, it veer to the right and drove on the should lane. the same thing happen going to  the right corner. when take off from the green light, sometime it slowly,slowly,slowly increase speed even though there is no car in front of it. when slow down, it wait the last minute and turn the car. all my stuff on the seat fly every where .when approaching a corner, it would speed up and make a quick turn.. when using a navigation, it turn intoi a dead end instead of the right route."
"twice in the past two weeks, while on autopilot, the car has decelerated spontaneously and dangerously at the same spot on the freeway. the first time almost caused an accident when the car in back of me had to brake suddenly and swerve. i thought it was a fluke when it happened the first time, but it happened again today. luckily, no other vehicles were in the immediate vicinity. my car had just passed under a large overpass and was near passing under power lines. i reported this to tesla via the voice activated 'bug report' feature within seconds of the occurrence."
"bought this car new for my daughter to drive back and forth to college, i wanted a safe car for her, but this car is anything but safe.  started having issues with getting random steering assist warning lights, then tpms lights, then it shut down in the middle of an intersection and it had to be towed.  the dealership has been unable to find anything wrong with the car and now its out of warranty and is costing us hundreds of dollars in service fees.  battery has been replaced and its still having issues.  lately she has been complaining that the car suddenly drifts at highway speeds and she has to make corrections that jerk her all over the road.  it does this at random, not every drive, maybe every other, it feels like an electrical issue and not a mechanical issue.  she has almost crashed twice, was pulled over this past weekend coming home for another dealership visit because an officer noticed the weaving and corrections and assumed she was drunk.  again, the dealership cannot find anything wrong.  i have explained the issue, brought in a technical bulletin that explains the exact issue, still no resolution, they still say they cannot find anything and send me home with another bill.  this car is not safe to drive, and once winter hits and the roads become slick, this issue will likely result in an accident.  i have refused to let her drive it to college at this point and the car is sitting in my driveway.  the dealership is useless even after showing them hundreds of internet complaints.  why is gm ignoring this issue?"

"i got this 2012 ford fusion se for daughter and yesterday, she called me to tell me that the ""power steering assist fault"" showed up on her dash. as she was about to try to back out of the driveway, she could not turn the steering wheel. she had to miss school and work, due to the issue, because i did not want her to take any chances. when i got home after work, to move it into the garage, to check it out, the dash code went away and it appeared to be fine. after doing research and calling the ford dealership, they found a recall from 2015 that describes this same issue in 2011-2012 ford fusions but for some reason my vin was not included, it seems that it's the same part and issue, that could/should include more vehicles. from what i've been reading and seeing, this seems to be happening more frequently, but actually seeing that people have been getting into collisions, with the intermittent computer glitching of the steering issue. it's just a good thing that my daughter was just attempting to back out when this happened. i see that others have not been so lucky. i pray that ford recalls this and does the right thing prior to any serious injuries and/or deaths, to avoid heavy law suits and trajedy. this was a issue with these cars and appears to be growing by the numbers and nothing is being done at this point. didn't do anything about it. i hope you will do your do diligence on these issues and fix every one of them before someone does get hurt. my daughter is drinving the car, because there are not other alternatives right now, but i pray that she does not get hurt while driving this car. thanks for your time and consideration."

"i was driving on interstate going 70mph with the adaptive cruise on and my speed suddenly drops to 50 ( like snapping your fingers ).   scared the heck out of me. when i stopped i checked the front sensors to make sure there was nothing blocking it. a couple weeks later the same thing happened going about 70 on interstate and the speed suddenly drops to about 50, but this time the truck behind me almost rear ended me.  both times when the speed dropped like that i was freaking out and trying to get my foot back on the gas and get my speed back up.  a couple weeks later i was going about 35 and did not have the adaptive cruise on and it suddenly stops again. this time the crash warning light showed up on the dashboard and the error warning came up and said the autonomous breaking system is disabled.  we took a picture of the dashboard. on the bottom left corner of the picture it says cruise and shows the error lights on the dashboard. cruise was not on so i assume it was part of the error that came on with the dashboard lights.     i am scared to death to drive my car now. i have 2 grandkids that are in my car 3-4 times a week. god forbid i get hit and something happens to my babies!!!    i took the car to hendrick kia in concord, nc so they could see what was wrong. when they hooked the car up to the computer no error codes showed up.  one of the guys has been driving my car home and to work for 2 days and the problem has not happened again. i don't know what to do now."
"tesla reboot while driving on a freeway!    super scary experience driving home on cold and rainy october night in my one year old 2019 model x. i turned on my auto-pilot and within few seconds, the dashboard as well as the speedometer turned black.  the dashboard turned dark, lights out, and the car seemed to be free rolling at a high spped on the freeway...no indicators, no speedometer. nothing. i thought that the car systems failed and i panicked, did not know what to do and my whole life flashed in front of me with the impending catastrophe. i continued driving. after a few minutes i turned on my right indicator (not knowing whether it was working) with the intent to exit the freeway. after a few minutes i managed to exit the freeway, found a spot to stop the car and waited for the functions to resume in 5-7 mins.     afterwards i called up tesla roadside assistance. to my surprise, it seemed that they are aware of such issues. they advised me to not to use autopilot feature for 24 hours. they promised to evaluate the reasons and get back to me. it's been 2 days and i have not heard back from them.    from the user forums i gather that this incident happened due to rebooting of the car's systems on its own and is not rare and other owners have expereinced this nasty issue. i am shocked that how could tesla not fix this issue when they are aware of this? by not fixing this issue, we are waiting for a tragedy to happen or probably it happened already and no one know of the reasons. i am scared to drive this car knowing that this issue can happen again. i have put through undue stress and psychological trauma due to this incident."

"while driving around 45 mph on co. rd. 1, i came to an s curve.  i made the left turn and i started to make the right turn the dash flashed a warning ""steering assist malfunction"". then the steering locked up, i wasn't able to make the turn, i was driving with my 3 children in the car. my 13 year old in the front passenger seat looking dead on at an approaching vehivle as we shot through the opposite lane. by the grace of god and the quick reactions of the driver, the huge dodge 2500 was able to turn away from my vehicle and we both ended up in yards on opposite sides of the county road. my child could have easily lost her life or been severely injured. thats the most traumatizing of the many recent occurances. most of which only consist of trying to turn into parking spaces and when turning from stop signs and i'm able to quickly stop i just have to work harder to turn."
"driving on highway at 65-70 mph with auto pilot and speed control engaged. went to change lanes from left to right. put on turn signal, cancelled auto pilot by turning steering wheel to right and moved to open right lane. there were no vehicles around us at all. the car suddenly, unexpectedly, and very shockingly slammed on the brakes causing items to be tossed around in the car, engaging all of our seat belts with some discomfort, and sending some loud alarm or warning sound to go off in the car. it scared me, my wife and daughter very much. if there had been a vehicle in the land behind us, there's no way they could have avoided hitting us very violently and causing injury and property damage. this happened 2 or 3 times in my former 2016 model s, but i never expected it in this 2021 model. a google search will reveal the vast number of tesla drivers who have had the same or similar experiences."
power steering assist failure- this could lead to a wreck causing death. very unsafe with how quickly this appears. going 60- 70 mph down a curvy highway and this kicks on losing the ability to steer your vehicle! all it does is ding and a message appears telling you that there was power steering assist failure!!! only have estimates to fix this so far and looking at $3000. had it towed back home from another town which was $100.
"tl* the contact owns a 2010 ford fusion. the contact stated that the power steering assist warning light illuminated and the steering wheel ceased in the locked position while attempting to drive. the contact stated that the failure recurred twice. the contact stated that there was a recall on the steering for the previous year vehicle however, her vehicle year was not included. the contact called balise ford of cape cod (90 high school rd ext, hyannis, ma 02601) and informed the dealer of the failure. the dealer informed the contact that she would receive a callback. the manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. the failure mileage was approximately 114,678."
i was beginning to back out of a parking space with my two young kids in the car after visiting the dollar store when my car froze up i looked at the dashboard it said power steering assist failed or similar to those words. i put my car in park and i turned my car off turned it back on and the same message came across the dashboard. i pulled forward to the spot in front of me and i could not turn the wheel. i had a family friend drive it down the street to my home. no leakage of fluid present.
"i was driving my car this morning this happened 4 times, i was in a stop when i would restart the car to go my steering wheel would do a quick shift to the left then back to its original position then i would get the steering assist reduced sign for second then disappear. it did it 4 times in a matter of an hour and a half. and did it once last week with no massage display."
"vehicle is stalling without warning at low or high speeds, with loss of brake assist and steering assist. multiple visits to dealer have not solved the problem as dealer claims he can not duplicate. in several of the stalling incidents, a critically hazardous condition was created.    stall has occurred both in straight line travel and in turns at intersections."
"the lane keeping system made me beer to the left three different times when there was no lane next to me.  one of those times it tried taking me in a wall.  when this happened all three times, the steering was hard to control.  my car was in motion.  it happened twice on a county country road and on the expressway going inside a tunnel."
"on two occasions the  acura collision mitigation braking system ""cmbs"" engaged erroneously and aggressively.     1)whilst traveling on an interstate in heavy traffic at a speed of about 50 mph,  the car we were following momentarily braked then quickly accelerated.  accordingly our vehicle was braked, and upon releasing the brake to continue to follow the flow of traffic, the rdx's system misread the clear road ahead and automatically braked, hard, fully stopping the vehicle.  the vehicle behind us skidded to the shoulder to avoid hitting us, and it almost caused a multi-car pile up.      2) while driving on a two-way two-lane road the system engaged while rounding a bend of about 30 degrees at about 25 mph.  a vehicle was coming around the apex of the bend in the opposite direction (other vehicle bending to the left) just as our vehicle also reached the apex of the turn (bending to the right right); the cmbs flashed ""brake"", but as no braking was warranted nor applied, the cmbs system flashed ""brake"" on the dash and subsequently braked abruptly, again stopping the vehicle in a traffic lane with a clear road ahead.     we currently have two other vehicles with forward collision mitigation systems and have had that features in three other vehicles since 2015.   i've never experienced this type of behavior.  "
on a recent 2500 mile trip on 3 separate occasions while on interstate hiways and  passing a vehicle the emergency braking system engaged automatically with warning lights and buzzers going off. this occurred with no other vehicles anywhere around for a quarter mile or more. on one occasion it occurred while driving in the right lane and with no vehicles in sight.    lexus special tech inspected the vehicle and had some calibrations performed but they will not tell me what they found in data captured by the vehicle computer or what actions they took and why they think the vehicle is safe to drive.
"2020 ford explorer st with approximately 5,200 miles. yesterday, i started the vehicle and put it into reverse and it started to roll backwards even though my foot was on the brake. regardless of how hard i pushed the brake, the car continued to lunge backward until i fully depressed/repressed the brake. with my foot on the brake the vehicle continued to move. this same event occurred a few months ago but when in drive and the vehicle continued to lunge forward despite my foot full pressing the brake as much as possible. i shut off the vehicle, waited a few minutes, and attempted to restart. restarted without issue. today, i attempted to start the car and all lights on the dashboard began flashing and the engine failed to turnover. the in-dash display then began beeping, flashing all service/hazard/warning indicators, and cycling through the following error messages:   - steering assist fault service required;  - see manual (with wrench icon indicating powertrain fault);  - front camera fault service required;  - service advancetrac;  - full accessory power active;  - park brake fault service now;   - pre-collision assist not available;  - check park aid;  - reverse brake assist not available see manual;   - hill descent control fault;  - normal cruise active adaptive braking off;  i turned off the vehicle and attempted a few more restarts ranging in intervals from an immediate start/stop, 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes without success (same error messages displayed as described above). my next attempt was a few hours later and the vehicle started without error, but did not give any indication that the vehicle had failed to start the previous time and the 'powertrain fault' wrench icon remained lit.

"tl* the contact owns a 2013 ford f-150. the contact stated while driving 70 mph, the power steering failed to operate as needed with the power steering assistance fault and advanced track warning messages displayed on the instrument panel. due to the failure, the contact pulled over and restarted the vehicle however, the same failure recurred less than two miles later. the contact drove to his destination and called crown ford (256 swain st, fayetteville, nc 28303,  (910) 600-6598) where an appointment was scheduled to have the vehicle repaired. the manufacturer was not notified of the failure. the vehicle was not yet repaired. the failure mileage was approximately 136,000.

"luckily had just stopped and put the vehicle in park, steering wheel shook, and then received error message of 'steering assist fault service required'. placed the car in reverse and realized i had no power steering. performed a code scan and received a u3000 error. taking vehicle to ford tomorrow for additional diagnostics."
"tl* the contact owns a 2019 nissan rogue.  the contact stated while his wife was driving 20 mph approaching a rail road track, the brakes locked up. the forward collision avoidance warning light illuminated. the vehicle was taken to boch nissan south (685 s washington st, north attleborough, ma 02760, (866) 663-0067) and diagnosed with a faulty radio sensor in the bumper. the vehicle was repaired however, the failure recurred. the manufacturer was not contacted. the failure mileage was 23,235."
"  as i was driving, thankfully at a slow speed, and making a right hand turn there was a complete failure of power steering. i loss complete control of steering and went into oncoming traffic. when failure occurred, several warning lights simultaneously popped up but as i was under the duress of trying to avoid a collision, i do not have a complete list but i did see the steering assist system failure and requires service all blinking red. there were no adverse road conditions nor driving style and absolutely no warning whatsoever. the vehicle has approximately 93,000 miles. i had to cover the cost to tow the car to a ford dealer shop and they tell me that the issue cannot be replicated but they believe it is a rack and pinion and steering/column failure and are quoting me over 2500 for repairs. as this issue has been happening to hundred if not thousands of owners of the same make and model, years 2011-2014 and 2015-2017 (if not later) fall under this same failure recall, this matter needs to be addressed immediately. i fear getting behind the wheel of this car and am lucky that i did not cause a serious accident due to this vehicle failure.

"first time back in june 10th, 2020, i took it in because of ""remote not detected"" they could not duplicate the problem, few hours later, same day after i picked the car up it went haywire while parked. it threw itself into theft mode, would not let us manually lock the car, electrical was still on but engine was shut off, alarm, windshield wipers, and lights was going off while i had it towed to the dealership. this time they've told me, the a/c condensation fried the cpu module because the only thing keeping water out of the cpu was a tray. september 9th, 2020 i take it back into the dealership because again the car kept reading ""no remote detected"". they claimed it was my ""dash cam"" that caused the issue. october 14th, 2020 the car again went haywire while in motion. this time it threw itself into theft mode, alarm went off, wipers, was reading low fuel (full tank) steering assist turned on and off, brakes started locking mid busy street, steering wheel tightened also. i barely could turn it into a neighborhood street to get off the road. i had the vehicle towed back to the dealership again, through my triple a plan for the second time because i was ""out of the area"" that they could send a tow truck to. they tell me again condensation got into the cpu and wasn't even sure if it'll happen again if i continue to run the a/c. i picked the car up the next week and on october 25th, 2020 the car again would not read the keys.  every incident but october 25th, 2020 incident, i have let a supervisor from gm know of the situation, his name is [xxx] ext. i have recorded even phone records of every incident that's occurred.    information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6).  *tr"

"tl* the contact owns a 2010 ford fusion hybrid. the contact stated while visiting out-of-state in pa, driving at 35-45mph, the 'service power steering' warning light came on, but steering still worked. but when the key was turned off & back on, the power steering was totally gone'no power steering assist at all! the vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic where the steering angle sensor (built into the airbag clockspring, under steering wheel) was replaced. power steering was restored'. only for about 6 or 7 miles of mechanic test drive & contact's picking up repaired vehicle.  however, next day as contact was just starting out on the 1300 mile trip back home to ks, the 'service power steering' warning light again came on. based on earlier experience, the contact assumed the power steering would remain operable (even with the service light on) until the key is turned off. so, he continued to drive toward home without turning of the ignition'and the power steering continued to work. when, after 675 miles of travel, contact stopped at motel for the night & turned off the key, the power steering was totally gone again (no power assist!). contact completed the remaining 625 miles the following day'.but without power steering! upon arrival  at home, vehicle was taken to midwest ford (1100 e 30th ave, hutchinson, ks 67502, (800) 530-5789) for failed power steering to be diagnosed. the contact was informed that the steering rack and ball joints needed to be replaced. the vehicle was repaired by dealer. the manufacturer was contacted, and contact pointed out mfg. recall for the 2011-2013 fusions that missed the 2010's with same steering issues (nhtsa investigation for 2010's was re-opened in fall of 2017'still open). however, no further assistance was provided by mfg.. the initial failure mileage was 90,174. invalid vin*dt*jb"

"tl* the contact owns a 2015 ram 1500. the contact stated that while driving, the power steering malfunctioned with the power steering assist warning light illuminated. the contact stated that the vehicle was difficult to steer. the vehicle was restarted and the vehicle temporarily went back to normal operation however, the failure recurred. golling chrysler dodge jeep ram (2405 s. telegraph rd, bloomfield hills, mi 48302, (248) 334-3600) was contacted and informed of the failure. the contact was informed that the vin was not under recall. an appointment was scheduled which was still pending. the manufacturer was contacted and informed of the failure. the failure mileage was 108,532."
"while making a turn, the electrical steering assist disengaged for a few seconds and a beeping alarm sounded three times. this happened to me on another occasion. after the second time i got the car back home and parked it until i could determine what the problem is. found the same happenings on the nhtsa website. there was a recall on this problem and my escape was one of the recall vins. in 2014, i took it to ford dealership and they did whatever was required at that time. i never had an issue before the recall, and they apparently did the replacement to keep  the electrical assist from disengaging. from my understanding, they extended the warranty 10 years or 150,000 miles. my escape is at 191,000 miles currently. ford service says they cannot fix it without me covering the cost, and if another recall is issued, ford may reimburse me.   i believe another recall should be required as vehicles today are driven more miles that 150k. it is dangerous when the steering assist disengages as no power steering is available. the steering wheel is almost impossible to turn when the assist goes out. fortunately, i did not hit anything as the steering assist reengaged while still in my turn. if it had not reengaged at that exact time, no doubt in my mind that i would have hit the vehicle in the other lane. i was on a highway at the time it first happened and the second time it occurred i was turning into someone's driveway."

"tesla model s 2015 90d. i have a service appointment come november 30th 2020 for this but i have had multiple occurrences of the main panel and side panel display go completely crash and black screen on me. disabling both the ""autopilot"" v1 feature in mid use on a highway going 60+ mph, gps and other important assistant information such as vehicle speed etc(because screens are black). its a very jarring and dangerous experience going fast on the highway and having the car ""crash"" in such a way that just gas and breaking are all that are suddenly left working in an instance(especially when you have that auto pilot feature engaged on a turn). i strongly recommend nhtsa to continue their investigation towards this as there are likely serious flaws with the emmc system and software these early model s cars released with. i am afraid tesla is going to give me the run around and not handle the situation appropriately, which would generally be a consumer recall when events as dangerous as this occur. i would say these full system crashes have occurred at least 5+ times since i have owned the car in 2015 and it seems like a matter of time before a serious crash could be caused by this faulty engineering . tesla currently is trying to do as much damage control around it offering  to look into a replacement part but no guarantees its covered by their warranty. as a software engineer myself it feels very much like when hardware starts to go bad, like a system internals beginning to fail due to corrupt memory and storage. these early tesla model s'es are a ticking time bomb to public roads(i say this as a tesla fan, when working the cars are incredible to drive, when they dysfunction its a very serious problem because of the nature of these software driven vehicles their hardware/software has to be rock solid)."

"tl* the contact owns a 2015 hyundai sonata. the contact stated that while driving 60 mph, the vehicle loss power steering assist and the steering wheel became hard to maneuver. the contact pulled over and the vehicle regained power steering functionality however, the failure recurred. the contact stated that the power steering warning light illuminated on the instrument panel. the vehicle was first towed to the residence and then towed to hyundai inland empire (25072 redlands boulevard, loma linda, ca 92354, (909)-796-1600) to be diagnosed. the dealer performed a diagnostic test that located a failure code at the power steering. the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was not contacted. the failure mileage was 135,000."
"my steering wheel will not telescope up/down. i have had this repaired 2x's in the past 3 years. 5/2017, 6/2018, 8/2019, 12/2020  additionally, the blind spot assist notification goes off when there's not a car around me. typically happens when i'm driving and go down a slight decline in the road."
"we own a 2013 tesla model s 85, rear wheel drive, no autopilot.  as vehicle aged, the steering was noticeably vague and the vehicle became ""darty"" on the highway, seemingly wanting to drive out of the current lane on its own.  this dartiness became worse and worse over time, and also was worse when accelerating or decelerating.  we first alerted the dealer of the problem in aug 2019, and they replaced few components in the front suspension (both upper control arms and the right forelink) and charged us $1571+tax for parts and labor.     the steering seemed a little better for a while, but in jan 2020 we brought the car back in with concerns about vague steering and the dealer recommended a wheel alignment, which we paid for.  the alignment yielded no improvement and the car became increasingly difficult to drive on the highway, requiring constant steering adjustments to keep in its lane.    we brought the car back to the dealer in may 2020, and by this time the dealer verbally agreed that the car was not safe to drive in its current state.  they replaced both rear lower control arm assemblies and charged us $1382+tax, but this still did not resolve the dartiness.    we returned to the dealer later in may 2020, and they recommended replacing nearly every other suspension part, including both rear toe links, both rear upper links, both front aft links, the front fore link that wasn't previously replaced.   the cost for this was a $1870+tax.    fortunately, the steering issues did not result in any accidents.  since this last repair, the car now drives relatively normally for a 7 1/2 year old car.  we are reporting our experience after we learned that the nhtsa is investigating a series of other suspension-related concerns with tesla model s cars.  we believe it is unreasonable for a car to become unsafe to drive in 7 years subjected only to normal personal use."
"service stabilitrak, stabilitrak initializing, steering assist reduced drive with caution, and park assist off are all dash errors on 2016 chevy tahoe that dealer is unable to fix after several attempts and costly repairs which resulted in full control of vehicle driving on highway and roads.  steering  tightens,  abs braking affected and traction is reduced when vehicle is in motion.        "
"without cause: the vehicle will suddenly detect the presence of another vehicle and/or sense an imminent collision and subsequently applies the automatic braking system, causing the vehicle speed to suddenly decrease. this has happened repeatedly over the course of driving the car and resulted in being almost rear ended numerous times.  this is a very dangerous scenario and could easily cause a severe accident, especially on the freeway when everyone around is going really fast and needs more time to react to the sudden and sharp slowing down of my vehicle. this happens in various locations, freeway, highway, or in the city.  i have taken the car to the dealership numerous times to have this fixed, but get a different answer every time i take it in. but the problem remains unresolved and continues to place me, my passengers, other drivers, and even pedestrians in harms way."
"no power steering assist, this is 3rd time this has happened. previous repairs have been to wire connections. this time we were informed module is not communicating. cost of repair estimated at $2,100.00. shop informed me that dealer says there are over 900 modules on backorder.  obviously there is a problem.  the car was being driven when this occured. steering absolutely very difficult. feel fortunate that didn't have to make any evasive manuvers to avoid an accident. very unsafe."
"power steering assist fault error, would intermittently appear. a restart of my car would clear it. the other night, after starting the car when it was parked, it appeared again, but this time it didn't clear with shutting the car off, and restarting it, then another message appeared  about servicing the advanced trac appeared.  i was able to drive it home in manual mode, and there it sits.  after researching this error, it seems that there are many others with this same issue."
"i was following my wife's car on the expressway.  her speed was 55 mph.  i had the adaptive cruise control (acc) on my vehicle set for 70 mph, so naturally i was only 'pacing' her at her slower speed, about four car-lengths back.  suddenly, my car accelerated rapidly toward my wife's car in front of me.  i had to hit the brakes to avoid a collision.  at that moment, a warning appeared on the instrument panel stating that radar obstructed. but even then, i was able to recreate the same scenario four more times before turning off acc for the rest of the trip.  i also noticed that while the car was surging forward, the instrument panel indicated that there was no car in front of me, even though there clearly was.  it was almost as if my car 'couldn't see' and decided to accelerate anyway.  the system should have failed in a safe manner, but it clearly did not."
"tl* the contact owns a 2012 ford fusion. the contact stated that while driving at an unknown speed, the steering wheel seized while the power steering assist warning light illuminated. the vehicle was towed to valenti ford (72 jerry browne rd, mystic, ct 06355) where it was diagnosed that the steering rack needed to be replaced. the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was not notified of the failure. the approximate failure mileage was 129,000."
"having many issues that seem to follow the reported symptoms of failing emmc memory, however tesla told me that it is not the issue and that the emmc just needs ""refreshed"" for $95.59.  it sounds like a way for tesla to delay the inevitable replacement or avoid replacing the module.    also, i think it should be illegal for an automaker to leave a feature such as autopilot in ""beta"" form indefinitely in a production vehicle.  i suspect the feature (that was quite expensive) will never be actually finished since development is probably no longer happening on older vehicles."
when driving on the highway using adaptive cruise control it will shut off and say 'collision warning not available/ adapted cruise control not available' it is intermittent but has not been working for 2 days now. as well as if not working normal cruise control doesn't work.

power steering went out a couple of odd times throughout the course of a few weeks   it ended up coming back on and off but is now completely off.... fortunately  for me it was while i was stationary each occurence..... displayed on my dash is (power steering assist fault) along with (service advancetrack) as ive been reading there has been many complaints of this issue to no resolution from ford and now it is happening to me....
"while operating vehicle at high speeds the advancetrac light, traction control light, and no steering assist light came on. before i could get off the interstate i lost most of my steering. luckily it was at night and not to many on the interstate. it was an extremely dangerous situation for myself and my family.  very lucky we didn't get in a serious accident. it was worse than loosing power steering with a hydraulic power system.  there was no control available while trying to get over."

"prior to 10/2/2020  numerous reboots usually after being parked. had to wait excessive time since i had pin to drive enabled. disabled pin to drive since i was getting stuck. it is embarrassing and not a good reflection on tesla products to have to wait 5 minutes to move your car. something is wrong.    10/2/2020 while driving on i 40 noted there was a lack of turn signal sounds. noted navigation did not seem to be updating to current position. while on autopilot the car started to drift toward an exit. the autopilot had disengaged with no warning sound' nothing. continued to steer manually. screen went black. ac stopped. after several minutes the screen rebooted. had to re-input destination.    10/3/2020. went to ashland nc supercharger to top off before getting on the blue ridge parkway. was only getting 4 kw to start finally giving up after 30 minutes achieving a maximum of 10kw. when i unplugged i got a warning ""reduced power, systems shutting down. service required. vehicle may not start"". the screen went black and after time finally restarted and i was able to continue.    later in cherokee nc the screen again rebooted after charging at a j1772 station.     10/4/2020. while driving with on i95 near st augustine i noted the loss of turn signal sound again. the navigation was frozen again. again there was no sound or warning disengaging or engaging autopilot. the screen went black. the ac went off. i observed the tesla t come up then the screen went black again. then the tesla t came up a second time and after several minutes the controls started working again.     again at nov 19@ 7:03 pm: driving west in i-4 stanford, fl. same as on 10/2. loss of autopilot, loss of turn signal sound, loss of climate control, loss of music. took 6 minutes to reboot. took an additional 5 minutes for navigation to restore.     there are more instances but i am out of characters."
"so what happen was ever since i got my 2018 golf gti autobahn dsg, i've experienced issues with the transmission, it jerks when slowing down from 2nd gear to first and sometimes from 4th through 1st. i took in the car to the dealership and they said nothing was wrong i took it to them multiple times and they still said nothing is wrong however i have showed them proof that there is something wrong with the car, i have a scanner tool and it shows that i have multiple codes for transmission and other stuff as well. the car has 7600 miles which is basically brand new considering its 2yrs old. also when reversing the transmission may disengage repeatedly, this happens mostly when reversing on an incline, however the incline is as little as 1.5-2%.the lane departure keep feature is dangerous, let me explain why. when driving on a road that doesn't have visible lines the system may jerk the steering wheel hard to one side depending on road conditions, if a driver doesn't have a good grip of the steering wheel, there is a high risk of a crash. the suspension in this car is amazing but when it was new, now it feels like the car has no stability and does not absorb bumps in the road.my 2013 toyota corolla le does a better job at absorbing bumps than my 2018 gti with adaptive dampening. my car used to feel like a super expensive mercedes-benz or bmw when it came to suspension comfort but now its just not the same at all.so the other day this crazy driver slammed on his/hers brakes and the automatic braking system engaged which is good cause no accidents happened, however the car had a hard time accelerating after, it felt like the front brakes were still engaged, but after 1 long minute the car started moving again normally until you try to reverse and then it started jerking repeatedly while going in reverse.this car needs to be recalled especially the 6 speed dsg transmission"

"i noticed a serious safety issue with subaru's lane keep assist safety feature: when driving on a busy highway over an area where the dotted line had been painted over with dark paint (by road workers to cover it up for a new lane to be painted) lane keep assist registered it as a line that still exists and forcefully steered me into the lane on my left. to avoid hitting the car in that lane, i forcefully turned to the wheel in the opposite direction.    luckily i am a healthy man who was able to steer myself back into my lane, but it turned my wheel with about three times the force of regular lane assist: i think many people including younger people and the elderly are at an even higher risk levels if they are unable to turn the wheel like i did. it was a much more forceful turn than subaru's regular 'non-urgent' lane keep assist.    there were no visual obstructions present that the eyesight camera was picking up: it was registering the old line that had been painted over. this is extremely important because not only is this a safety risk for any type of road work that paints over lines during construction or repainting, but this also poses an immediate danger to life and health to people driving on roads with lines that have been painted over and left in that condition. the computer registered the dark line, meant to visually cover up the old paint, as a white line!    i confirmed that this is a systemic issue and not just incidental with me. i found a post on a subaru forum where two people describe the same situation i had. i will link that below.     https://www.ascentforums.com/threads/lane-keep-assist-malfunction.9530/        i tried reaching out to subaru but they did not reply. i brought this up to my subaru dealer who only checked for recalls. i need this to get the attention it deserves, people are going to die here. they probably already have."

"driving down the road and a message pops up on the screen.  it says ""steering assist fault"". it should have said omg don't panic and slow the truck to a complete stop and try not to die because you have lost all of your steering capabilities. i could not imagine if i was around too many vehicles or one of my children were driving the truck.  this is such a major safety concern that all f150s with this potential problem should not be driven until repaired.  with all of the safety measures and companies such as you guys why on earth is this truly life threatening issue allowed? apparently, the 2013 model is not part of the recall for this problem? there are many complaints and many easily found forums talking about this issue. there has to be deaths attributed to this issue.      for what is worth the other issues are nonlife-threatening but noless annoying and should be recalled.  i have two 2013 f150 fords and both have had their rear windows replaced due to the defrost breaking. the lariat has had it's replaced twice, twice! both trucks have had their sunroof guts replaced.  one almost flew off the vehicle driving down the highway.  complaints and forums galore talk about all three of these issues."
while traveling with adaptive cruise engaged we were in left lane following a semi approximately 1000' ahead of us and when he moved over to make an exit our vehicle passed by and auto braked hard causing vehicles behind us to take evasive action from hitting us along with vehicles in the right lane of traffic. this also happened again the following week except passing by a dump truck. i was aware that time an mashed accelerator in time as instructed as per operating manual. i don't feel safe using my cruise with or without adaptive on and now several weeks later i'm getting an 'adaptive cruise not available' message displayed on instrument panel.

"this 2020 subaru outback touring xt ran well for the first 10,000 miles.  we were informed it had a recall and this was corrected 1/06/2021 by carboone's subaru in utica, ny.  after the recall repair when the adaptive cruise and adaptive steering are engaged if the vehicle appeared to leave its lane the warning message is 'put your hands on the steering wheel'.  before this it was 'lane departure'.   if the adaptive steering is not engaged the warning  remains 'lane departure'.   this behavior happens on all roads when the adaptive steering and adaptive cruise can be engaged.  it occurs at all speeds.   this warning to put your hands on the wheel occurs when your hands are on the wheel and is not consistent with what is happening   (lane departure) nor what the vehicle warnings are when not using the adaptive steering.  this presents a confusing picture to the driver and could lead to an inappropriate response to what is happening and cause an accident.    subaru's response to the change of warnings is 'this is normal behavior'."

"when driving with the adaptive cruise control on the vehicle frequently abruptly decelerates while trying to pass other vehicles.  it does not matter if we are behind the vehicle we are trying to pass and pull out in the left lane, or if we are always in the left lane and just approach the vehicle we are trying to pass while always remaining in the left lane like on an interstate.  our vehicle is always safely in our lane and doesn't come anywhere close to the vehicle we are attempting to pass.  we have taken the vehicle to have the camera adjusted three times to no avail.  it is unsafe to drive with the acc on as the abrupt deceleration can result in us getting rear-ended at passing speeds.  we no longer use the acc feature of this vehicle when approaching other vehicles to pass."
"while driving at highway speeds with the adaptive cruise control engaged, the vehicle detects vehicles to the right (same direction of travel) or at times vehicles to the left (opposite direction of travel) and abruptly applied backing. no vehicles will actually be in lane of travel of the vehicle to cause action. on a 87 mile drive (one way to work) happens more than eight times on first drive and over ten time on second drive. vehicle has under 1500 miles on it and was purchased brand new.     taken to acura and told to turn off lane departure system unless in city traffic. system turned off and did not correct issue. the abrupt braking causes drivers behind to abruptly brake, increasing risk of crash, and also angers them because they think you are 'brake checking' them.     weather was cloudy or clear."
lane assist will not stay on even on freeway or new road.  comes on and goes off for no reason.  nissan service person told me its new technology the road must be perfect to work properly.  why would you put in a technology to keep you in the lane and it doesn't work 30-40% of the time.

"while driving in autopilot my mcu (tesla controller) occasionally fails. this means the autopilot computer works fine but all audio notifications do not work. the autopilot will change lanes for me without the normal auditory notification. turn signals are silent. the mcu will then completely freeze (no touch input and gps frozen while driving) requiring either a manual reboot by myself or it crashes completely and reboots itself.    5 visits to my service center in the past 13 months of ownership to address this issue have not resulted in a resolution. they tell me they ""flashed the storage"" or ""upgraded the firmware"" but the car continues to prove this did not resolve the issue. autopilot functioning without notifying the user of maneuvers could be deadly. it is a self driving car but still requires drivers to pay attention and take over if autopilot makes a faulty decision.    i have videos of this happening.    attached i have uploaded invoices from the service center showing i have brought mcu failure issues to them on multiple occasions and continue to have issues. note that line item 14 on the invoice dated 01132021 tesla inaccurately states my no audio on automatic lane change issue. i requested they rephrase this issue to the issue i reported but they refuse to put this in writing. why? suspicious."

"my vehicle's battery drained out because we hadn't been driving the vehicle much due to covid stay-home orders in michigan and staying at home over the holidays. we rolled it out of the garage and jump started it in the driveway, then let it run for an hour to recharge the battery rather than driving it because our power steering and advance trac were showing fault messages and it was very difficult to steer the vehicle. the messages didn't go away after we turned it off and restarted it.  we even left it overnight and tried the next morning. the messages are as follows:    low battery features temporarily turned off    steering assist fault service required    service advance trac    there are also two warning lights showing a car skidding, one with the text ""off"" under it.  i believe these are the traction control warning lights.    looking on the internet, i see there have been recalls for steering problems related to the  electric power steering assist systems    https://www.consumerreports.org/car-recalls-defects/ford-recalls-sedans-and-suvs-steering-problem/    http://www.fordproblems.com/epas/    i contacted ford to see if they could provide some advice or assistance.  there don't seem to be any recalls associated with this issue for my vehicle's vin.  they suggested i try turning it off and turning it on again (a ""key cycle"") to see if it would reset, which i have done a few times with no success.  they then suggested taking it to the dealership to have it checked out.      i don't feel safe driving with the steering wheel being so difficult to turn, so will need to have it towed. i also i fear i could be expensive to get this fixed if ford does not recognize this as a service issue.    i thought i should document this in case other vehicle owners have experienced similar problems and this is in fact a systematic issue, not an isolated case.

"when my mcu fails, i receive a message that says, ""autopilot safety/convenience features unavailable."" tesla's text messages to me state:  - ""the issue that you experienced with the center display resetting .. was a continuation of the firmware issue we had identified...""- ""this was caused by a known firmware issue"",- ""we do have a couple of known firmware issues that causing occasional resets or slow performance"",- ""since there are no repairs to be made at this time .. i will go ahead and close your service request"" [and effectively refusing to repair my car under the warranty adjustment program]  this issue is not an academic or financial one. i was driving on an interstate freeway in heavy rain approaching a needed charging stop when i suddenly lost control of the heat and defrost systems, the cruise control, all navigation displayandcontrol, and the ""safety systems"" which i assume are aeb. i had to either risk pulling over on the freeway, which is never completely safe, or scramble with the navigation on my phone to make sure i know which exit to take. on several other occasions, i have lost similar systems and the back up camera feed as i was backing up or needing to back up.  tesla has refused to honor its warranty adjustment program in writtentext messages, is creating an ongoing risk to the public, and seems to have, in addition to the known memory issue, a known but uncorrected software problem that significantly implicates safety. i strongly encourage nhtsa to follow up on the issues raised by tesla's actions asap.      thank you for your attention to this matter."
for years i have been getting an error message that says 'power steering assist fault'. i turn off the engine and restart and it's gone for awhile. i took it in to the dealership and they could not recreated the error so they sent me home. yesterday i got the same error but a restart would not clear the message. i drove it to my mechanic with this message and a new message that says 'service advancetrac'. the fix will be about $2300. i knew that 2011 models have a recall because i have researched this error on multiple occasions over the years. it's upsetting to see that this has been happening to people while in motion and i don't understand why ford won't cover this safety hazard on the 2010 like they have the 2011.
"while my wife was driving in the local community on a trip to her relatives house, out 2016 honda accord touring model's automatic braking warning light and associated application of the brakes came on at least 4 times within a 9 mile drive. each time there were no other vehicles or obstacles near the car. i plan to make an appointment with the dealer this week. i have read dozens of similar complaints about this same issue with the honda collision mitigation system. i think a recall for this issue may be necessary."

"the other day i was stopped at a red light, awaiting green in a left turn only lane.  it was a long light and i may have been distracted by a conversation with my passenger.  i am 99% certain that i did not have my foot on the brake pedal because i rarely use it now-a-days with regenerative braking and tacc.  the green light chimed and i instinctively pushed upward on the right stalk, double checking (in my mind) that i had disabled tacc and autopilot, knowing that i was about to turn left.  unfortunately this 'conditioned' behavior of mine inadvertently put the car in reverse!!  i pressed the accelerator and nearly backed into the car behind me.  it completely caught me off guard since my expectation was that the car would move forward.  obviously i was wrong.  the driver behind me was disturbed, however i did avoid making contact by hitting the brake pedal.      while i certainly realize that i am fully responsible for the confusion, i do believe that tesla safety engineers might want to explore this scenario and seek out a preventive safe-guard.  perhaps software can prevent car from switching to reverse unless the brake pedal is depressed.  or maybe a much larger ""r"" indicator that blinks and beeps.  i'm sure it is an easy fix.

"car brakes suddenly without cause. brakes are applied abruptly simultaneously with visual warning. no obstacle present. this occurs at low speed (less than 30 mph) on city streets. seems to be triggered by bright lines on road surface (railroad tracks, rumble strips) perpendicular to travel direction.when using adaptive cruise control car misinterprets vehicle in deceleration lane on interstate as being present and slowing in travel lane in front of it. this results in rapid deceleration in the travel lane. fortunately there have not been any vehicles following close when these events occur. brought car to dealer multiple times without resolution of the problem."

"while using the acc function and setting forward distance at any length the problem is that when the car in front of you slows, stops,,or turns my vehicle will brake on its own.  however, while braking during the mentioned operation the big problem is that the brake lights do not illuminate. i have had several close calls with someone nearly running into the back of my vehicle during the use of the adaptive cruise control (acc). this can be extremely dangerous if you are now fully aware of this problem.  this should have been addressed during the acc hazardous examination phase. a very simple fix would be to install an i/p switch in the brake line at the master cylinder so that the pressure from the acc applying the brakes sends the pneumatic signal to an electrical signal that lights up the brake lights. this problem should absolutely have been caught and addressed during the design phase.  i found out when i asked a service manager about it and he said the lights do not come on. he also said they know about it."

"i parked my car, and upon returning i started it, and received a waring stating that there was a ""power steering assist fault"". from that moment, i have no power steering and the vehicle is extremely hard to steer. when i took it to my mechanic, he plugged in his code reader and cleared the code, which brought the power steering back on line. some time later, the power steering went out again, to which my mechanic cleared the warning code, and the power steering was brought back online. the steering assist continues to fail, and it got too expensive to have my mechanic clear the code continually.   i've addressed this issue with ford, and they state that the power steering recall 14v284000 service has already been completed on my car, but obviously it didn't prevent the loss of the steering: electric power assist system.    ford states that i am now responsible for the cost to repair the loss of a system that they are aware of as a very dangerous problem with their product. why would i be responsible for the cost of fixing something that their repair was insufficient at preventing? are they not responsible for providing an actual solution to the recall item, not just a temporary fix to satisfy the recall requirement?    my milage and dates of occurrence are estimations, as i do not remember the actual date of the initial failure."

"started car in driveway and had no power steering. dash light displayed power steering assist default. shut off car twice and got it back. i wonder what would happen if it went out when i was driving. i'm a woman. i would not have the strength to control the car. i would crash. ford does not have a recall for this year, but others for the same issue. does it take death to have a recall?"
i was driving down the road and all of the sudden a warning light alerts appeared and said power steering assist fault. then the car suddenly because very difficult to turn. followed by traction control warning. i have service the vehicle as required and have records it has been serviced in a timely manner for its life time.
"car suspension felt loose and weird.  under normal driving (city streets and highways), changing lanes or going over roads with slight crown or ruts caused the car to suddenly pull and shift erratically (above and beyond that experienced in other cars). it felt as if there's something not right with the front suspension.  when this happened on highways while using autopilot (experienced at least three times), the car swerved left and right erratically (after changing lanes) in an effort to re-center on the lane without success, and i had to take over manually in over to avoid from flipping over or an accident. tesla service center inspected the car in late 2019 and said everything is normal. they performed a 4-wheel alignment but did not improve the behavior.  this behavior has gotten worse over the past year and is very concerning.  i only have a little over 30k miles on this car, and therefore do not expect suspension failure at this low miles."

"i put a new battery in my car and when i started it the power steering assist fault light came on. i turned it off and did this two more times and it started and the power steering assist fault light went off. i went to work and in the morning i started it and the power steering assist fault light came back on. i turned it off and on a couple more times, but it wouldn't go off. i got it home and there it sits."

"i requested many times to have our car checked for nhsta campaign : 19v493000. the dealership said our car was not included in that case. our lane assist was too aggressive from the first day we drove the car. the dealership said the steering was speed sensitive and we were driving too fast. we explained that we could not keep the car in the lane when driving over 40 mph. in the first 24 months we carried the car to the dealership 20 to 30 times for the unsafe steering issue. twenty four months later we had a rock chip the windshield and the chip ran into 3 cracks each over 8 inches long that afternoon while the car was in our home garage. after we paid a $500.00 deductible and the dealership replaced the windshield , the car drove better. the battery has been replaced three times, the fuel pump replaced, all the sensors on the tail gate have been, the passenger side window would stick 1/2 up, and many other problems. a scan of the car shows 10 modules failed with many active codes. the codes are the same as before the third battery was installed. many of the codes are safety issues."
vehicle made a sudden right turn when it was on auto pilot and because of that there are minor cosmetic damages to wheel and tire. manufacturer doesn't accept any fault when it was humanly impossible to control the vehicle because of sudden turn.
"while driving on a city street and turning a corner, the power steering assist warning appeared on the dashboard display.  the power steering quit working.  i had to stop in the middle of the street and restart the vehicle to engage the power steering.  this has happened before but while the vehicle was stopped.  this issue was subject to nhta recall 14v-286 regarding 2013 explorers (recall number 14s06), but my explorer was not included with the ones that were recalled.  my local ford dealer is unable to schedule a repair appointment for another month so i will try to locate an independent repair shop that can fix the problem."

my 2016 colorado is experiencing the exact same issue as the 2015 colorado covered by gm recall 15595.  often when driving the vehicle power steering assistance is lost and the steering reverts to manually steering and is very hard to control the vehicle and get the vehicle to a save place.  gm states that my vehicle is not covered by the recall even though many 2016 colorados have the same issue as the 2015.  the initial recall apparently did not cover enough vehicles.
"my ford escape hybrid steering wheel started to exhibit odd behavior as we were driving to hike a trail in mill valley. the wheel would pulse/turn to the right a little bit real quick and then go back to normal. this happened 3 times while waiting at a red light. the light turned green and all was normal again as we drove another 5 miles to our destination. we got out of the card and hiked for about 90 minutes before returning to the car. once i started the cad, i noticed the steering wheel was very hard to turn. i had to drive 2 hours home from the hike location with absolutely no power steering assist. i took the cad into our local ford dealership and was formed there are no active recalls for our vin and it will cost over $2000 to replace the faulty electronic steering column. also worth noting, we purchased this 2009 ford escape hybrid brand new at 300 miles. at just 4,000 miles, yes 3,700 miles later, the steering column went out and ford replaced it under warranty (of course). so now, here we are again, about 100k miles later, and the steering column they put in is again faulty, and they are unwilling to do anything about it, wanting me to pay the full $2k+ to replace it and for labor."
"ford has a recall case 14s06 for the power steering on 2011-2013 ford explorers.  in this recall it notes that individuals will experience a loss of power steering.  my 2013 explorer is not included in that recall but, is experiencing the same issue and is not covered under this recall.  at slow speeds you can hardly turn the wheels...making it a hazard on the road.      my wife came got out of work and went to make the 5 mile drive home when she noticed she could hardly steer the vehicle out of the parking lot at work.  a message came on noting power steering assist fault.  my wife is a very small and struggled to turn the wheel but, managed to get it home.      in talking with the dealership and ford customer care, they note the recall does not include her vehicle as it was made at a different time or in a different batch and is not covered under the recall even though it is the same issues experienced by those that had loss of steering in the recall.  frustrated that ford is allowing vehicles that are experiencing this to be on the road.  at the time of filing this complaint, there were 1339 complaints on the 2013 explorer and 481 of the complaints were on the steering, the most of any category, and yet ford is not standing behind what seems to be a major issue in that year and model.  my vehicle has 86,000 miles on it.  many other vehicles have experienced this similar issue around the same mileage from what i can gather.

"lane keeping assist (lka) and lane departure warning (ldw) are important safety features, particularly for older drivers. these features, touted in chevrolet's online and print advertising, are poorly, and potentially fatally, implemented in the 2020 chevrolet bolt ev premier. the 2020 bolt ev owner's manual describes these features beginning on page 213. when turned on, lka is undetectable and no steering correction can be felt in the steering wheel. while ldw may illuminate a small amber warning signal on the graphically complicated driver's display, the manual states, 'additionally, there may be three beeps, or the driver seat may pulse three times, on the right or left, depending on the lane departure direction.' on page 215. a safe driver does not watch the complicated display to detect a small symbol turning amber from green. the lack of auditory or vibration warning rendered this safety feature useless. these conditions were observed in clear daylight on multi lane highways as well as in less hospitable conditions. as implemented in the 2020 chevrolet bolt ev premier, lka and ldw do not exist, though being used as a selling feature."
"a month ago, we were driving on the highway through snow showers up to nh to go skiing, with our nifty adaptive cruise control on, when i realized that we were accelerating into the car in front of us. i assumed that the front sensor was covered in slush, took off the cruise control and drove manually. only about 5 minutes later did the dashboard alert notify me that the front sensor wasn't working.    brought it into the dealer. they couldn't find anything wrong.     here's the problem: the car says ""trust me. if you use my cool safety systems, i'll keep you from hitting the car in front of you...and should something disable the sensor that carries out this function, i'll let you know, so that you won't depend on me."" but that's not true. and, a driver who assumed that the car was keeping its promise, as it does most all the time--might not have realized that it wasn't until they hit the car in front of them."
"i recently purchased my 2018 nissan rogue in august of 2020 and as of march 2021, i've had 5 instances where the front radar system for the cruise control feature malfunctioned while driving on the highway. the front radar sensor is part of the intelligent forward warning system in nissans and its job is to detect the distance between vehicles. the sensor is tied to the cruise control and emergency braking system.  the fault consists of a front radar obstruction warning light malfunction illuminating leading to the disengagement of the cruise control feature (if engaged prior to the malfunction) or the cruise control feature and the emergency braking system becoming disabled. also, when the fault appears, the brakes are abruptly applied before being released which is a very serious safety issue especially when driving during inclement weather as your relying on the integrity of your braking system. i took the vehicle to my local nissan dealership and they mentioned that there were no current recalls in place for this particular issue and that the system would need to be updated with the latest software update to see if the problem is corrected. i was told that i would have to pay approximately $150 to install the update to the system, which to me should be covered by the company due to implied safety issues.  i was surprised to hear that a recall was not in place for this system, considering this has been a known issue since 2014 and yet the nissan company has yet to issue any type of safety recall for the rogue models, hence my safety complaint. i fear that if this problem isn't corrected soon an unsuspecting driver could get hurt!"
"system will occasionally suddenly decelerate as i am passing, usually a large truck. i will be in adaptive cruise control and as i get abreast of the trailer, the vehicle will suddenly decrease speed by 10-20 mph, then accelerate back to the set speed. this, obviously, has the potential to create a rear end collision if someone is following and not paying full attention, esp if there are multiple cars following. this has happened multiple times."
this is a complaint about the beta release autopilot.  a random model 3 vin has been used to be able to file a complaint.  this complaint applies to all models of tesla.  here is a video of a proud beta tester.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pq-rgy1v8ug  this owner has a misplaced trust in the safety of the autopilot.  he is using it in high raffic areas with pedestrians and cyclists  he is also using it at excessive speed on narrow roads only inches away from oncoming traffic.  rather than having his hands holding the wheel in the correct way he only has his fingers touching the wheel with the palms facing the wrong way.  if anything goes wrong he will not be able grab the wheel properly in time to prevent a collision.  fingertip driving is unsafe at the best of times.  if autopilot has a glitch or a spasm the driver would be unable to quickly regain control.  despite the claims of elon musk such driver behavior does not lead to the beat release autopilot being revoked.  this experiment is deadly.  please get it stopped immediately.  thank you  keef.

"the lane assist feature (only an option when using adaptive cruise control; not the same as lane centering when not using the adaptive cruise control [the basics lane centering works just fine]) seems overly aggressive. each time i have used lane assist with cruise control, it jerks the car very abruptly at times, almost to the extent of sending it into another lane if i do not intervene. i no longer feel safe using lane assist, so i turn it off when using cruise control. i am very concerned it's going to cause and accident. this has happened at least 5 times now while driving on the freeway (every time i have attempted to use lane assist)."

"driving down interstate on nice clear day with minimal traffic, cruise control set at 70mph when suddenly the cruise disengages, warning light begins to appear on dash showing 2 cars colliding with audible alarm informing me that the front radar is obstructed. cruise control will not work and any attempt to use cruise control is met with audible alarm and warning that front radar is obstructed. i stop, check all radar/sensors for debri... everything is fine, no bugs, not debri, no obstruction. i restart engine, same warning appears before i even put transmission in drive. start driving, same situation, front radar obstructed, cruise not available. after 10 miles or so the flasing light goes off, everything returns to normal, cruise control works properly. car may experience this oroblem twice in hundred mile trip on perfectly clear day. other times it may not happen at all on a 100 mile trip. when this does happen in heavy traffic the situation becomes dangerous quickly because the automated braking is disabled and if the radio is on it's easy to not realize the system is off until your speed is reduced significantly. i have had 2 close calls because of this - one with a car in front of me stopping abruptly and the system failed to maintain the selected gap between my vehicle and the vehicle in front of me so i had to veer onto the median to avoid a collision; the second time the cruise abruptly disengaged traffic behind me almost ran into me which caused vehicles behind me to have a close call.    so far this problem has always happened on the highway or interstate, never in town. sometimes when it is raining really hard the same warning light & audible alarm will sound, however cruise control remains operational as does the automatic braking. so it appears to work properly at times."

"today, mar. 22, 2021, in my brand new 2021 tesla model y, which i have now owned for one month, i was sitting at a red light at a fairly large intersection on the outskirts of annapolis, md.  i had my foot resting on the floor as the car was stopped and in hold mode.  suddenly, with the light still red and on its own, my car accelerated through the red light into the intersection at top speed.  (i was the first car in line at the red light.)  i slammed my foot on the brake but nothing happened, it kept going right through.  a van crossing through the intersection in the other direction proceeding through his green light was narrowly, within an inch, missed by my car, which kept going all the way through until it finally stopped at the other side.  conditions were dry and the weather was nice.  it was approximately 1:00 in the afternoon est.  i continued to drive until i came to a safe place to pull over, and then called tesla service and roadside assistance, and found their attitude to be very defensive.  i was terrified to drive it so i had them come and tow it to the service center where they say they will look at the log.  about a day or two ago, a software update was pushed to my car; that was the second sw update since i bought the car one month ago.  this was absolutely the most terrifying thing that has ever happened in my 42 years of driving.  i could have been killed or my car could have killed someone.  thank god no pedestrians were crossing in front of me at the time, and that i somehow missed that passing van.  i   i felt the need to report this incident to the authorities -- i told tesla i want them to take back the car and give me a new one in exchange.  it is only one month old and has just 801 miles of driving on it thus far.  i was not using auto pilot, to my knowledge, nor was i using cruise control.  i do not have the self-driving package."
"at random times while driving the forward collision warning system and cruise control will stop working. on average it happens about every 20 to 25 miles and remains off for 2 to 3 minutes. it does not occur at regular intervals though, this is just the average. it was very difficult to get nissan to replace the sensor while the car was under warranty. they did not want to and finally when they agreed they said the part was on back order due to high demand so i'm not the only customer who has complained about this. the sensor still does not work properly and having the forward collision warning/automatic braking not reliable is a safety issue. having the cruise control not work is just an annoyance. at nissan's suggestions, i've cleaned the sensor many times and i've ensured that nothing is blocking the sensor. it is simply a faulty, unreliable part and i believe there should be a national recall. this has been happening for over 2 years now. it took many months of complaining and sending them pictures of it not working before they replaced the sensor the first time. that fixed the issue for a few months but now the second sensor on the car has been malfunctioning for over a year. i'm attaching a couple of pictures for example. this issue has happened over a 100 times to me though."
"i2 weeks ago i had my car's computer system updated as per the recall notice. everything was fine then 2 days ago i noticed on the heads up display ""cruise) which had never been there before. i set the speed at 65 on the freeway and it held the speed fine, however, as i approached another vehicle from behind it did not slow down to match the speed of the other car. i had to brake to avoid hitting it. i tried using the interval button to set the distance from the other vehicle but it did not work. i took the car to the dealer this morning 3/23/2021 and after 90 minutes they called me out to let me know what happened. apparently, if you hold the interval button down for 2-5 seconds it disengages the adaptive cruise control and the car is reverted to an older system that does not sense the spacing while on cruise control. i explained to them that i never had touched the interval button prior to the car reverting to this older system and it went to it by itself. if i remember correctly it went to this system while in motion by itself and only since i had the updated system installed due to the recall. if i hadn't been paying attention i would have rear ended the car in frontof me."
"ii was driving my gmc canyon and the power steering went out and the warning light came on and ""loss of power steering, drive with care"". i parked the care and waited 15 minutes, restarted the truck and the warning light went off and i was able to drive home without a problem. the next day i was driving at low speed and the same warning light came on with the additional warnings of ""stabilitrak"" and ""steering assist reduced"" and i lost power steering. i pulled over and restarted the truck and the light stayed on and i had no power steering.  i continued driving home without power steering and stopped for a short while and when i restarted the truck i had power steering again. i did a web search and it said 2015 and 2016 canyons and colorado's were having this issue but only 3000 we recalled. i wanted to make you aware of my problem and see if the recall should be for more than the 3000 vehicles."

"on march 22, 2021, i was parking my 2016 bmw gran turismo 328x at a parking garage. ii had completed the initial turn-in, when the car felt like the accelerator had been pushed to the floor.      the car went from approximately 5 miles an hour to about 20 mph in the length of a parking spot. the car hit the concrete barrier head on, with the side curtain, steering wheel and leg air bags deploying.     the car was fully maintained and serviced by the bmw dealer with brand new tires. it had about 78k miles on it. the forward collision warning did not go off nor did the automatic braking occur.     i asked the repair facility to check out why the car suddenly accelerated, but was told that accidents happen and that the car was totaled anyway.    i did not press the accelerator 'accidentally'. i have had hundreds of hours of drivers training and evasive manuvering because of my job and do not make mistakes like that.     i am grateful that no one other than i was hurt and that there was the concrete barrier to stop the vehicle. there was a police report made. the car has been totaled as there was more than 15k damage. usaa has the car."
"i was driving back home and the 'power steering assist fault' message came up on my dash. i didn't know what that was about until after about 4 miles when i was supposed to get off the highway but the steering just wouldn't turn. i immediately freaked out. i kept going straight for a bit and i then tried to force it towards the right shoulder (thanks goodness i was on the right lane already) but as i started to slow down the cars behind me would honk and the passagens would stare at me while passing like if i was trying to mess with them on purpose. that was scary and embarrassing. turned the emergency lights on and pulled over to call a friend who knows a bit about cars. i was told i was ok to force the steering in order to get home, although i was so sure it was going to literally break and come off in my hands. after around 13 miles i got home and my now both arms are totally sore and i'm not kidding. i wasn't even able to maneuver the car into my small garage since it's impossible to turn the steering wheel if the car is fully stopped. the car is there... parked and useless.   i just called ford and i was told i will have to pay for the tow truck to take the car to the dealership, for the diagnostic and to get the car fixed. seriously? i'm an college student full of stuff to pay and always living in a budget. it seems like the cost for this is over $1800 and there's no chance i have such absurd amount to fix this problem that wasn't even my fault. i need the car every single day since in utah there's no way you can get anywhere without it. i don't consider driving the car in this situation (it's probably not even recommended) and i've been borrowing my roommate's car, which i can't do for much longer for obvious reasons.    i wonder what ford is going to do to help not only me but all the unfortunate ford fusion's owners."
"while traveling on the freeway at 70mph, the car suddenly started flashing warnings of ""ev system required stop safely"", ""rbs service required!"", and the service engine soon light came on. also, i wasn't able to accelerate over 20mph. i quickly exited the freeway and turned off the car. when i restarted it, the car seemed to operate normally as far as the acceleration, but the service engine light soon light remained and the ""brake!"" forward collision mitigation system started to randomly kick in.    interestingly, in the week leading up to the system shutting down the forward collision mitigation system had randomly kicked in a few times, but i assumed there was something low in the road i wasn't seeing. i've also experienced issues with the audio system and rear camera in the week leading up to this incident; the rear camera twice never appeared when in reverse and the audio source would erratically switch from xm radio to apple car play on its own.    the vehicle had just under 1,700 miles on it when this happened."
"my power steering assist light is on and i can not steer my vehicle. i got in to take my kids out and i could not steer. its too unsafe to drive, and i read this is a known issue with ford under steering issue complaints. if my vehicle is covered to be repaired under a recall i would like to know the next step. its around $1000 to fix and i can not afford this."
"while driving on normal road with no other cars around, the emergency braking system/forward collision activated and immediately stopped my car with no danger present. this resulted in the car behind me swerve to avoid hitting me in the rear. no warning lights were on the dash or no audible warning either. this seems to be a malfunction in the system."

"the headlights (hid with auto-leveling) are pointed dangerously low. they do not illuminate the road ahead far enough. a driver would have very little time to react, given this limited illumination distance. subaru dealerships are adamant the headlights are adjusted to specifications. there are many complaints about this issue all over the internet from owners, and the dealerships i've mentioned this issue to have explained they are aware of the complaints, but there is nothing they can do. i am very worried for our safety and for the pedestrians/vehicles we would not see in time to stop. we purchased this vehicle new, and this is not a new issue. i have tried to address it for several years. when the vehicle is accelerating from a stoplight, for example, the headlights are basically fine (given the shift of weight to the rear which has the front of the vehicle aimed a bit higher), but as soon as the vehicle levels out, the issue is very evident. the automatic high beam feature simply does not compensate, as the automatic high beams are not intuitive enough to perfectly activate and stay activated every time (it misreads surrounding street lights, for example, as oncoming headlights very easily."

the steering wheel shakes when changing lanes at different speeds and it feels like there is no steering assist when doing this. i tried swapping tires but this didn't change things. it's really noticeable on the highway. i only have 47800 miles on the car.
after starting my car i went in my house to get something. my car slipped into reverse and rolled down my lawn across a busy street and hit a tree. the emergency braking system did not engage. i was able to drive the car back to where it was parked. i then tested to see if i could have accidentally put the car in reverse when i got out it. it began to roll in reverse and i wasn't touching the gas. i could not have gotten of the car if were in reverse because it would have been rolling. apparently when the car is in a parked position it can slip into reverse.

for no reason at all the steering assist fault needs serviced continuously comes on while driving or sitting still making it impossible to steer. has noticed this is a common problem among ford vehicles my car has less than 100000 miles on it. there's no rhyme or reason when it happens or any warning. could make a car crash a very real possibility.
"adaptive cruise control works well most of the time.  occasionally, it ignores stopped traffic and closes to a dangerous distance.  it then slams on the brakes and all warning lights go on.  the sensors are defective.  on two lane roads, the sensors detect oncoming traffic and flash the brake warning light.  when on cruise, the sensors detect cars making a left turn when passed on the right, and apply the brakes.  the same thing happens when on a freeway in the middle lane passing a car on the right.  the false warnings have happened since i purchased the vehicle.  it's been to the dealership numerous times.  they can't fix it.  the cruise problems were discovered on a trip to florida from january to march 2021."

"while driving at night even with no traffic ahead, the automatic high beams rarely turn on. when they do, they turn off almost immediately due to reflections from road signs and even small road markers. occasionally, they'll fail to dim in a timely fashion or will flash causing other drivers to think i'm doing this on purpose. other owners of 2020 and 2021 honda ridgelines are reporting the same useless and unsafe operation. i owned 2017 and 2019 honda ridgelines with automatic high beams and the feature worked reasonably well. from 2017-2019, honda used a dedicated camera for the automatic high beam function. for the 2020 model year, honda eliminated this camera and merged the automatic high beam functionality into the ""multi-purpose camera unit"" that is also used for other functions such as the lane keeping assist system feature of honda sensing. in short, the new automatic high beam system is not only useless, but offensive to other drivers. i'm afraid the flashing will induce road rage or gain unwanted attention from law enforcement officers. for now, i have disabled the automatic high beam system. the 2021 ridgeline's headlights are already a step backwards according to iihs testing (and my own observations) and i feel like the ""high beam assist' credit they apply should be removed since this feature is next to useless since the 2020 model year."

"2018 cr-v all warning light came on after starting car in preparation to go to work. as i was pulling out of driveway car was not getting any power car fluttered and i smelled gas. i turned it off then restarted it was ok. i took it to the dealership. they performed: (93760 tech verified concern.pulled codes p0300; p0301; p0302; p0303; p0304 and p0172.found warranty extension open for vehicle.19-032. 1245b6a 110 reset the maintenance minder.updated the pgm-fi and tcu software.replaced the oil;ac control unit and throttle position reset and pcm idle learn procedure.inspected spark plugs. 1245b6/.8 1245b6a/.3 03217/03214 fpn:37805-5pa-a85 and software update that they said the car needed and the lights went off. few days later light came back on went back to dealership then was told i needed the 4 fuel injectors $1300 to replace them. did some research online to find that several people are having the same issue. while these lights are on there is no cruise control, lane assist or anything.  called honda and there was no known issue. dealership suggested maybe honda will pay to fix issue... well, of course no such luck."
"while driving, vehicle's computer systems seemed to shut down entirely.  these included the multi-informational display in the instrument cluster and the primary infotainment display in the center.  vehicle's parking sensors, adaptive cruise system, and infotainment all went offline.  the screen went bright magenta and then completely shut down.  vehicle was on the highway during the incident in dense traffic within the bay area of northern california.  cautious measures were taken, and after exiting the highway and finding a rest stop, vehicle was shut down and rebooted 3x before system came back online."
i started my vehicle and i got a warning beep saw the display saying power steering assist fault. my steering wheel was vibrating and a loud motor type noise was sounding. i would drive and i could feel the steering  wheel shimmy while driving. the next day i started my car and display showed right away the power steering assist default. and i had no power steering from then on. other 2008s had recalls for power steering but my vin was not on the list for recalls
"at ~5,000 total vehicle miles, our 2019 model s performance had sudden and complete power steering assist failure at highway speeds, possibly concurrent with autopilot (autosteer) failure.  either i, or the autopilot system, turned off the autopilot feature at or near a slight curve on an interstate freeway.  immediate ""startle"" reaction was that the autopilot feature was ""fighting"" me for control as i turned the steering wheel to keep the car on the freeway, with extreme effort.  the reality is most likely that this ""fighting"" was only the immediate impression caused by the massive amount of effort required to turn the steering wheel, despite being at speeds in the 60-70 mph range.    soon noted a scrolling series of warning messages:    a.  ""steering assist reduced:  steering may require increased effort.""  [which is a gross understatement.]    b.  ""autopilot safety/convenience features unavailable:  features may be restored on next drive.""  [which, after the car had sat parked for ~30 minutes, were restored.]    user-visible mcu-display failure log revealed the following supplemental failure codes (with the probable times of failure)::    1.  17:26/app_w207:  autosteer temporarily unavailable    2.  17:20/app_w264  autopilot safety/convenience features unavailable:  features may be restored on next drive    i feel very strongly that this sort of power steering failure would likely have resulted in a less experienced driver suspecting the steering had ""locked up"" and be causal to a major accident.  given the circumstances of the failure mode, and at these speeds, fatalities could be likely.    of note, this is at least the fourth time this has occurred to us, but the first with this car; all other events were in a 2017 model s performance, also at very low total mileage.  after a failed repair attempt, that model s was traded in to tesla for this model s . . . ."
''power steering assist fault'. the power steering in my vehicle was rendered completely useless. fortunately this occurred when i started my car in the morning instead of mid-drive which could have been catastrophic as the car is essentially impossible to steer effectively without power steering.
"when we are stopped at a traffic light the forward collision avoidance alarm beeps/chirps a warning.   our vehicle is stopped, not moving at all.   the car in front of us, or next to us is also stopped, not moving.   out of nowhere, the collision avoidance light beeps causing us to be concerned that we might get into a collision.  it typically happens when the car in front of us is a tesla, mercedes or other high end car, but also occurs when the car in front of us is not a typical high end brand.   this safety concern happens randomly, not everytime we are stopped at a traffic light.   we have documented this with a video and provided this to the kia dealership.  the dealership refused to work on the vehicle without explicit instructions from kia engineers on what they should do.   the first time it was brought in, they cleaned the camera lens on the rear view mirror, but that was not the problem, only one way to eliminate an easy fix.   we have brought the vehicle in several more times and the service writers told us that this was a known problem and kia should have a fix, but it has been more than 1 year since our initial complaint.   i have escalated this concern to higher levels within kia and they are not willing to accept responsibility or try to repair this problem."

"i have issues with surging, ac system, suspension, extreme tire wear, tires wear unevenly, steering assist, inability to align steering, windows roll down for no reason and won't roll back up unless you roll them all the way down and then up but they usually just roll back down half way again (it's a battle!) windows scratch just from dust so they look hazy and windshields cost almost $2000 with all safety camera junk. only one aircon vent blows cold air while all others just blow air. this car was a lemon before 2018 ended. subaru refused to acknowledge problems while under extended bumper to bumper warranty. i tried to file lemon law and lost because they didn't save my complaint visits in computer system. im certain that was intentional since they are the lemon kings! subaru is a terrible company now and i recommend you don't own one. the surging is very dangerous as the car literally hops and sometimes you push accelerator and nothing happens for way too long. dangerous when pulling into traffic. fighting with windows while driving is also dangerous. led lights are the wrong color so it's hard to see many things at night. the battery is junk open top and leaks acid everywhere rotting out the battery tray. for $42,000 you would expect a much better car."
on sunday april 11 2021 i was driving my ford explorer 2011 glendale az and being in motion an alert pop up om my dashboard saying power steering assist fault leaving me with no steering since my steering wheel got really hard. looking online for any recalls i found one and called ford and they told me the recall was not valid because the warranty was expired.

"the 'power steering assist fault' warning light started coming on sporadically as of 3-25-2021 when i start my car.  if i turn the car off and turn it back on, the warning  message goes away.  i read the ford did a recall on some 2011 ford fusions for this problem but my vin is not included in the recall.  if my fusion is having the very same problem as the recalled fusions, i do not understand why my fusion is not included in the recall."

"i have ac problems, refrigerant leak, actuator problems, bad compressor.  i have serious cvt surging and suspension problems that make vehicle unsafe to drive.  the car literally begins to hop like you are stomping the gas and breaks back and forth and can easily make you lose control. it sometimes does nothing when pressing accelerator for way too long making it dangerous pulling into traffic.  windows roll down without pressing button and won't roll back up unless you roll them all the way down first and usually it just rolls right back down again. aweful trying to drive while fighting with windows that won't stay up.  suspension is so destroyed from the surging and hopping that it cannot be aligned.  the vehicle destroys tires rapidly and unevenly. gas mpg is terrible, especially if you run ac.  steering assist is dangerous and will sometimes jerk wheel away for no reason causing you to scrape curbs and nearly hit a pole once..  breaking assist is also dangerous as it will slam breaks for no reason.  lane departure beeps a lot for no reason.  wipers are garbage. windshield glass is too soft and all dust scratches it making visibility poor  the trunk often will not open no matter if you push button on key, inside car or on trunk.   the door seals fell off, cheap clips fall off that are supposed to hold important things in place, glove box shock broke. i'm sure there are other issues too.   suspension is a big issue however, completely shot from surging. far too expensive to get whole new suspension. dealership ignored all complaints and purged all records of visits so i couldn't file lemon law. subaru is very dishonest.   so many things need recall that it is a lemon pure and simple."
"the fuel pumps, made by supplier denso, were ""exposed to production solvent drying for longer periods of time"" during manufacturing, according to the nhtsa recall report, which could cause surface cracking and excessive fuel absorption and eventually cause the impeller to become deformed and fail. the fuel pumps on vehicles produced outside limited dates given on the report do not have the problem.  this recall did not include the 2018 honda accord models even though they are having the exact same issues. my car is stalling the emissions warning light is on along with the adaptive cruise control, lane departure, and the collision mitigation. i feel this should be included in the recall the put in place last year being that is is the same issues. my vehicle would stall in a parking spot at my home when i'm first starting it. it would flash a warning like a car is in front of me randomly when nothing is there. i haven't got into a wreak but i free that i may be in one if this issue isn't fixed and being that this was an issue with previous models i shouldn't have to come out of pocket. i brought this car brand new off the lot. there is no reason why i should be changing the fuel injector 3 years later."

my 2018 atlas lane assist pulls the vehicle into another lane without warning or intention forcing me to keep a firm grip on the vehicle at all times. this usually happen on a busy highway but it also happens on secondary roads as well.  it is scary for me as well as any other passengers in the vehicle. i have complained to vwofa aa well as the local dealer where i purchased the vehicle. they cannot find anything wrong. it is something that happens randomly.  they did a short test drive and found nothing but it keeps happening. for that reason i rarely use the vehicle. it is a safety hazard.

"historically (may 2019 - dec. 2020), the screens (showing speed, autopilot status, and other information) would sometimes go blank.  i reported the problem in my 1st week of ownership (in may 2019) and periodically thereafter.  tesla remotely sent a fix from time to time, but the problem persisted.  i then learned from the media (not tesla or the nhtsa) that nhtsa had mandated a fix on 2016-2018 model x's because of screen failures.  i asked tesla to fix my 2019 (noting that it appeared to be the same problem as what had req'd. the nhtsa mandate, and tesla did fix it (or said they did) a few months ago.  but on april 13, 2021, the problem came back and far worse.  on that day and while driving my son to upstate ny by highway, the screen did not simply go blank (at least not initially ... it did eventually) but first ""froze"" for over a minute while falsely stating that i was still in autopilot (hands off pedals and steering wheel) going roughly 70mph on a highway.  again, during the freeze, the screen (frozen) falsely said i was still in autopilot (when, in fact, autopilot had disengaged).  i alerted tesla to the problem april 14 and brought the car in for an april 15 fix.  tesla addressed it, but i can have no confidence in the fix (1) given the history; and even more so because (2) tesla's invoice falsely describes the problem as simply a ""blank screen"" (which is not nearly as dangerous, bc the driver is at least alerted to the problem), and said simply that its ""engineering team is aware about this issue and is currently working on a reliable solution. issue will be resolved in one of future firmware revisions.""  this seems dangerous and unacceptable."

"after driving the car for about 1.5 hours, we stopped at a convenience store. when we restarted the car, an error message appeared on the drivers information screen that said: ""steering assist fault service required"" (please see attached photos) and the vehicle had lost power steering. this made the vehicle extremely difficult to drive but we were fortunately very close to our destination. this was the second time this error had occurred, the first time was on a much longer drive but after sitting for 10 minutes or so (vehicle off) the error went away when the vehicle was restarted. this time, even after letting it sit overnight, the error has not gone away and there is still no steering assist. i have found many posts about this very issue with the ford escape vehicle (and other ford vehicles) and am very surprised that there is not a recall for this very serious problem. if the loss of power steering had gone out while driving at highway speeds (as has happened to others), the result could have been fatal. please take this issue very seriously. thank you."

"i would like nhtsa to force automakers to stop using names for their driver assistance features that overstate the capabilities of those features. a driver assistance feature should be allowed to be sold as autopilot if it cannot pilot the vehicle automatically. a driver assistance feature should not be allowed to be sold as ""full self-driving"" if it cannot drive itself fully. it is deceptive, dangerous, and wrong.

"this 2020 honda civic si has been nothing but trouble.  from the start i had the windshield crack on me from what honda said was a tiny chip.  i went in to work with my windshield seemingly fine only to come out to a spider web split all the way across the windshield.  honda would not cover citing it to be just an 'accident' and i would have to get it fixed.  the windshield absolutely had to be replaced with factory oem glass due to safety features which was on back order so i was forced to drive around with a broken windshield for close to 2 months.  company that installed glass said this is becoming more 'normal' so to say as the glass they are using is paper thin in his words.  on top of that from day one of owning the car it has the 'safety' feature of lane keep assist and this feature will literally pick up heavy shadows on the road from power lines and try to correct you as if you are driving out of a lane!  countless times i have had to hurry and over ride the assistance just to keep it from making me run off the road!  honda severely needs to look into this on top of their unsafe thin windshields which crack from the tiniest of pebbles hitting them.  also,  i just had to replace the clutch and components in this vehicle after just 20k miles and less than a year of owning the vehicle.  honda offered nothing but a one time good will assist in paying for partial labor and parts.  this started happening after a normal drive to work one day while going up a hill the clutch started slipping.  made an appointment and took the car in and was told to put another 100 miles on the car and bring back to them although they said they found a transmission leak and needed to find the source .  this was certainly very unsafe as while doing those 100 miles the clutch completely burnt out and i was left stranded on the side of the highway and i was put in a dangerous situation."

"when vehicle is on, safety features like lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, blind spot indicators, traction control, door locking, hands free phone call answering and hanging up buttons on steering wheel are all not working. my information sceen is locked and cannot be changed."
"the car thinks the trunk is open but it is not. as a result, the car doesn't stop beeping as a warning to a trunk that is fully closed. in addition, i can't open the trunk at all. when driving the car i can no longer use autopilot and other safety features of the car. i also can't lock the care. all and all, the car in unusable, because of an issue with the trunk, this is definitely a faulty design."

"i keep having a error code come up on my dash that says ' power steering assist fault !' my car wheel will lock up randomly ; resulting in me not being able to turn the wheel . i have to park, turn off my car and turn it back on . it's been doing this randomly on and off for the past 6 months and i am afraid it is going to endanger my life as well as my family's if i do not get too the bottom of this . i've seen there were similar recalls with the same make model but my car year was left out of this recall, not sure why! online quoted for this repair is over $2000 and if this is a manufacturing fault it needs to be addressed .*dt"

"regularly, perhaps every 2 months, my car's automatic emergency braking system will activate without cause. it has always happened on a highway and it seems to be related to when i pass a large truck. the system will trigger, causing a beeping noise and an image of a car to show up in the heads-up display. about half the time, the brakes will be applied very hard. this situation only lasts for perhaps a second or two and then disappears. there is never a car in front of me so there is no threat and no reason for the system to trigger.    as i mentioned, it seems like this false (or phantom) trigger coincides with passing a large truck.    part of my frustration with this is that when i speak with bmw service, they say they are unaware of any such issues with the system but that i'm welcome to have them review it for several hundred dollars. since i'm not confident that the mechanics at my local dealer can or will find any issues with the system i don't want to simply throw away this money.    i'm enthusiastic about these new safety systems but the manufacturers should support them for perhaps 10 years. they should be required to investigate false triggers and also to annually check the system is working reliably. without this, people will begin to turn these systems off as they begin to fear them as i do.

i bought my civic new on 2016. the car starts to have steering become jerky and tends to stick in the center position after driving on the highway more than 20 minutes on 03/15/2020.  when that happens the car drifts to the left side and i have to use a extra force to pull it out of that sticking point back to the center steering . i did researched this problem on carcomplaints.com and found 107 complaints on honda civic 2016 eps jerky problems.  i also found honda recall 18v663000 ( power steering assist fails ) on civic and crv 2017-2018 but not included 2016 while civic 2016-2018 use same eps assembly part no.53650-tba-a01 that fix the eps fails.   i brought my car to honda dealer to diagnostics the problem on 05/2020 was 52k miles but they can't confirmed it because it appears after at least 20min drives so they don't want to spend that much time to drive on highway!   i noticed the problem intermittently relative to the weather temperatures and the problem appears few month after i brought my car to dealer for honda recall vsa and parking brake software updated.   it's challenging to drive a straight line when the problem appears . today 04/28/2021 my car has 57k miles and still have same problem but can't afford to pay over $2500 to replace the eps assembly due to out of manufacture warranty. i am deeply disappointed to own a car has less than 60k miles with major safety issues on eps unpleasure to drive.              
motor cycle was stored in garage over winter in chicago area.   started it up on first day in 80 degrees and getting codes p0552 and p0551.   the bike displays the handel bars on display.  research shows problem with do's which is a steering assist unit.   brp (manufacture) of the motorcycle had had prior recalls on the same unit in prior years.    many people on the internet having same issue that results in 2000.00 dollar repair.   bike still runs but you can feel steering is harder.  although the bike is a 2014 i only put a few thousand miles each summer driving it local.   a bike with just over 10k mies should not pop a two thousand dollar repair sitting in storage.    i see this as a safety issue since it impacts your ability to steer and avoid road side incidents and distracted drivers.   i always have my wife on the bike and bought a three wheel unit to give both of us more of a safe ride.   i would appreciate you looking into this issue.

"shortly after purchasing the car it received a software download called emergency lane departure avoidance which is tesla's fancy name for a lane departure warning system. i have taken the car into their service centers 3 times to have it repaired because it only works <50% of the time - never works during rain, shadows on the road, and various other normal road & weather conditions. each time i get the car back from the service centers i'm informed that that system is working normally. in late june of 2020 i purchased their basic auto-pilot software system for $2,170 which is a combination of both lane keeping assistance (tesla's self steering) and adaptive cruise control (tesla's traffic & road aware cruise control). this software has had ""glitches"" and malfunctions ever since the purchase. i contacted marie moore (assistant manager at tesla's bellevue, wa) about the issues and i was told that this software was a ""self leaning"" type and would improve with use. the first issue was the while driving on the freeway with auto-pilot engaged the car would veer right a few to several feet toward most on & off ramps un-nerving myself & passengers as well as getting close traffic upset enough that i would get honked at or worse. it gradually got better so that it would only veer right significantly less. however on 4/19 my car received a new software download that stated it would improve the auto-pilot & cold weather performance. i drove the car on a 140 mile freeway trip only to discover that the car would radically veer right on ~90% of all on ramps! twice it nearly jerked the steering wheel from my grip and attempted to steer completely off the freeway & onto the on ramp. i made an appointment at the lynnwood, wa service center on 4/26 and was told once again that the car was performing normally & there was nothing they could do; & same with cruise control issues"

"this company is selling an aftermarket component (literally dead weight!) to enable drivers to override tesla's safety constraints on full self driving. namely, they are selling a counterweight aimed at fooling the tesla vehicle into accepting that the driver's hands are on the steering wheel as required by the autopilot.     this is profiteering on an extremely dangerous and (i believe) illegal practice that puts tesla drivers, their passengers, and every car on the road at risk.    i drive one of these cars and would never even consider this. but there are people who would.    https://www.taptes.com/products/taptes-model-3-y-counterweight-ring-autopilot-accessories-automatic-assisted-driving-ap-fsd-steering-wheel-weight-booster    note that this is not a complaint about tesla, it is a complaint about an irresponsible third-party company.    this company is not listed on your equipment list, and there is no ""none of the above."" so i selected something at random."

"on occasion, while at hwy speeds with no cars in front of me  my car will suddenly start braking. this worries me that people following to closely might not be expecting my car to brake as their us no immediate traffic in front.    also, the lane assist frequently fights me when i am within my lane. it appears that concrete scratches or marks in the road sometimes confuse it."
after turning left at a signaled intersection onto a highway the automatic braking engaged and the car skidded to a stop in the middle of the lane. luckily nobody was behind us. there was a car about 4 car lengths ahead that was going the same speed and was not stopped. i pulled over and checked the front sensor and noticed a couple black flies on it and brushed them off.
"the vehicleâs adaptive cruise control and collision mitigation braking system are flawed. the vehicle will give false collision alerts (large brake sign on screen and shaking steering wheel) when oncoming traffic is approaching to the left of you. both vehicles are in their respective lanes. also, the adaptive cruise control will slow down or suddenly brake the vehicle when a vehicle to your left is driving slower. there are no vehicles directly in front of you. both vehicles again are in their respective lanes. i have video evidence of this that i can provide. i have made honda and dealership personnel aware of this. no one representing honda has been able to resolve the issues. one service manager said he canât do anything to fix it until honda releases an update, meaning this person acknowledges there is an issue. another service staff stated to me that his wifeâs honda pilot has the same issue and implied i shouldnât worry about it. this is a serious flaw and i expect honda to release an update to address this issue.  this issue has been occurring since i took delivery of the vehicle (november 2019 with less than 1000 miles) and has been ongoing until present. the date and mileage listed is one of the most recent occurances.

"i was driving east on may 7, 2021, on i-94 toward new buffalo, mi, on a clear day; no rain. a semi-truck was going 60 mph in the center lane of three lanes. i moved to the left lane to pass as i was going about 70 mph, the posted speed limit. there were no cars ahead of me in my lane for as far as i could see. another car pulled up behind me very closeâway too closeâtailgating me. i was passing the truck and was parallel to the truck when suddenly the tesla automatically slammed on my brakes!!! the idiot who was tailgating me fortunately reacted quickly and also slammed on his brakes and simultaneously swerved hard left onto the shoulderâthereby averting what could have been a fatal accident!! my car could have been pushed into the wheels of the truck on my right and we could have been killed!! i was badly shaken but, fortunately, we were not injured and there was no crash. when we arrived at our destination i phoned the salesman at the chicago tesla sales office and described the incident. i asked him if i could disable the automatic braking feature and he talked me through the procedure. the tesla has a rear-facing video camera. i believe tesla should program that camera to see a tailgating car and make certain that no automatic braking be engaged if a car is following too close!!  i believe tesla should investigate why this happened and should reprogram the software yo prevent it from happening again. i sent the tesla company two electronic messages through the tesla phone app as the tesla salesman suggested, but i have not received any response more than one week later. this is irresponsible!! we could have been killed yet tesla has ignored my two messages! if tesla does not fix this problem, it is certain that people will die in a parallel situation. we were just very lucky."

"the center touchscreen will intermittently freeze when started and not recover when driving. when this occurs the hvac and radio hard buttons also stop responding which prevents control of the defrost, creating a visibility hazard that could result in a crash. sometimes the freeze will result in the backup camera remaining on while driving forward. when in reverse the freeze results in the backup camera guidelines, parking collision warning and rear cross traffic warning being unavailable. failure of these systems intended to prevent collisions is a safety hazard because unavailability of these systems could result in a collision. the freezing did not occur frequently when the vehicle was new, but over time this has become a frequent occurrence. the vehicle is available for inspection upon request.  the problem has been reproduced by a dealer and been subject to repair twice, but the issue has continued to occur after each repair attempt. the vehicle was subject to bulletin 20-na-119  which was intended to correct radio screen black/freezes after boot up, but this does not appear to have resolved the issue.

"i have a 2021 honda ridgeline sport equipped with cmbs an automatic braking system that is supposed to be a safety feature, but actually makes the car more dangerous.   the problem with the ridgeline sport collision mitigation braking system is that it attempts to mitigate crashes when the system thinks an obstacle is ahead, but it is a false warning, and there are no actual obstacles.   it appears there is a software or sensor defect in the honda sensing technology causing the vehicle to issue warnings and alerts to the driver and the potential to automatically hit the brakes without warning when there are no obstacles in front of the vehicle and it has not deviated from its lane.  service advisor/mechanic at dealership called it a computer glitch. nothing they can do. taking it back again to have it on record; dealership tried to fix vehicle. this vehicle is potentially dangerous with no way to correct concern at this time. problem continues since march 2021.

"the electronic controls black out while driving the entire center screen and electronics shut down disabling the warning lights and i think also the electronic systems that function to control the safety warnings and functionality. this has been a problem on an ongoing basis since the purchase of the vehicle. this has been ""repaired"" multiple times by the dealer under the direction of subaru. there was a recall earlier this year that was supposed to correct the problem it added some functionality, but primarily this recall reprogramming of the electronics was supposed to correct the blacking out of electronics and the disabling of the safety systems. the recall reprogramming has not corrected the problem. when i complained to subaru they suggested that i take a video of the failure when it happened. i explained that this was not possible because i was driving at 70 mph when it happened and could not just grab my phone and start a video while driving on i-95. last week i was able to get a video of the failure as it happened while my wife was driving and i was a passenger. the entire panel blacked out and she pulled to the side of the road and i took a video of the 4 minutes the system was out. i will attach this video to this report.   in addition there is an additional problem that occurred related to the lane keep assist function. there are four options to configure this function they are: 1> off 2> warning buzzer only 3> lane keep function only 4> all functions. my understanding of the operation of this system has one function that shuts the system off that is obviously the off function. #2 although only a buzzer has the system on, #3 has the functionality working but no warning buzzer (my preferred choice) and #4 that has all functions operating both warning buzzer and lane keep functions. my concern is that if you use #3 the system shows a warning light on the dash that shows the system if off.  i have video of the electronics but don't know how to upload it.

electric power steering assist stop working while driving. no power steering in vehicle at all. looked online and seems to be a very common issue with these vehicles that should be recalled.

"on the dark evening of 23 january 2021 a deer from the side of the ohio turnpike came onto the edge of my lane of roadway, did a uturn and kicked the front fascia of my car. i slowed but couldnât avoid the collision because of nhtsa rule federal motor vehicle safety standard (fmvss) no. 108. i did not see the deer in time to slow further, which would have allowed emergency maneuvers. if i was driving this same car in europe, or canada or japan, i would have adaptive driving beams on my vehicle. there is often only seconds to act at night, at speed and the glare from oncoming drivers contributes to this lack of safety on american roads. nhtsa has allowed tesla to experiment with unproven technologies such as âautopilotâ on american retail vehicles, with lidar/radar, cameras, software and now the removal by tesla of the lidar/radar functionality, which, allegedly, has resulted in deaths of drivers on us roads. however, nhtsa has been negligent by delaying passage of revisions to fmvss 108 to allow adbs on us roads, a proven safety technology in the eu and around the world, requested by toyota and mb and other manufacturers in 2013 and since. this is inexcusable on nhtsa part. this either represents incompetence or negligence on nhtsa part, since there has been insufficient regulatory revision in eight years! as a former emergency medicine physician and now radiologist who has traveled to canada and the eu, and having cared for patients injured at night in vehicle crashes, as well as being involved in my own that could have been prevented, i can not understand the delay by nhtsa of eight years to complete this approval when the overwhelming evidence proves the technology of adb not only safe and effective but enhancing safety of all concerned, including pedestrians.   here is a link to the most recent article supporting this proven technology:  https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/news/we-need-to-legalize-adaptive-driving-beams-already-for-safety-s-sake/ar-bb1guahr"
"while driving at approximately 10 mph, the message ""lane assist currently not available"" was displayed and lane assist deselected in the system menu.  later, while parked, i re-enabled lane assist using the menu system.  this problem, along with others, has been ongoing since 2019.  since 2019, volkswagen have been unable or unwilling to correct any of the problems experienced with the vehicle."
i was driving this said ford motor vehicle and suddenly the steering wheel became very stiff and difficult to steer and maneuver. immediately a warning light appear on the dashboard stating  power steering assist fault.   this said ford suv experience a loss of power and require extra effort to steer the vehicle. this increases the risk of a vehicle crash and place my safety and the safety of other motorist and/or pedestrians at risk.  i hope this concern can be addressed in a timely manner. thanks in advance.  
"the eyesight turned off and would not turn back on. then the airbag symbol lit up on the dashboard. my cruise control and lane assistance were not working as well.   if i had been involved in an accident, the airbags would not have deployed.   the warning messages appeared about 3 weeks ago. "
repeated violations of autopilot safety systems has forced tesla to activate in cabin cameras to be used as an additional safety device for driver monitoring.   not all vehicles have in cabin cameras and should be installed for increased safety concerns 
"cadillac case number is 9-6766521074. the cadillac ct6 has a flaw in the intelligent braking assist(iba) software. when no collision is imminent, pushing the brake even slightly results in extremely hard overbraking causing all items to fly forward. there is no way to turn off iba without disabling the entire automatic emergency braking system. to be clear, it is ok that the car senses inaccurately a collision and it is ok to apply the automatic emergency braking logic, the problem is that the intelligent braking assist is too hard when a crash is not imminent and this will cause following cars to rearend the xt6 when no hazard is expected/present.  as an interim, please direct cadillac that they update there system preference software to allow customers to turn off intelligent brake assist (iba) independently while still keeping automatic emergency braking (aeb)."

recently purchased a 2012 ford fusion sel 3.0 6 cylinder car and the power steering assist fault indicator light was on and its really hard to turn my steering wheel due to the power steering going on its messed up my front end alignment and now my ac doesn't work. i need this fixed and i have paperwork stating that nhtsa recall for my year model vehicle will be free of charge to repair it. i really need my car fixed i threw my should out of place due to the hard steering 
"suddenly while driving and making a right turn the steering locked up, the car jerked to the left into oncoming traffic. the ""steering assist needs service"" indicator light on the dash came on and then went off. as i looked for a safe place to pull over the car continually jerked from right to left and i had to keep pulling on the wheel to keep it straight. i phoned gary yeoman ford in daytona beach fl to check for recalls and was told there were none. i called ford motor company in dearborn michigan, customer complaints and spoke to a representative and was told there was nothing they could do. i then asked to speak to a supervisor and spoke to ""supervisor angel"" and was told the same. this car has less than 40,000 miles on it and this should not be happening.  this is very dangerous and could have caused a very serious accident. there have been other recalls for this same problem, but not for the year 2015. i looked online and there are other complaints involving the same power steering problem on these ford escapes. it is now in the shop for repairs at my expense!  est $1400"
" on may 9th we were driving on the freeway at around 3 pm on a sunlit clear day. it was a straight section of road. dry pavement and traffic moving reasonably well. the car in front of us was at least 100 yards in front of us and about the same for the vehicle behind i believe. we were going around 50 mph. the car slammed on the brakes so hard the seat belt restraints engaged as we flew forward, enough so that my wife and i were both sore the next day. items on the back seat flew onto the floor. if there had been a car behind us we would have been rear ended and potentially a multi car pile up. we took the car to the dealership the next day. they had the car for the day and returned it saying everything is calibrated as it should be. i have called acura and they set up a case number and a case manager and said they would call me. they have not called nor returned my repeated phone calls. i have asked for a supervisor to call and that has not happened either. acuraâs case number is 12213602 and simon is the case manager. his phone is 800 999 1009 x87723. the supervisorâs name is terry. i donât have an extension number for her.  we have grandkids that ride in car seats in the back seat. thank god this didnât happen with one or both in the back seat with a car behind us.  we have been driving cars with the braking feature on them for 10 years now (ford and infinity) and have never had anything like this happen. weâve had the adaptive cruise pick up on something in the past and ease off the accelerator but never anything like this. the cruise was not engaged when this occurred.  in googling this it sounds like we arenât the only ones having this issue.

electronic steering assist is intermittently failing causing loss of power steering. other vehicles of this model and year have been recalled for this failure. my vin is not included in this recall. warning light notification comes comes on dash. power steering is lost. also steering wheel vibrates when stopped at a traffic light. 
"on starting the vehicle for the first time of the day, console display indicated lane assist was disabled.  it was necessary to access the menu system and re-enable lane assist.  lane assist was enabled when the vehicle was parked the previous day.  lane assist has many times somehow become disabled and cleared on the menu system while the car was parked overnight.  the problem and others have been reported to volkswagen several times.  after lengthy service visits since 2019, volkswagen have been unable to correct or explain the faults.  volkswagen insist no error codes have been recorded in the system.  all thing considered, the ongoing absence of error codes may be yet another fault."

"i consider this a vehicle safety issue. was on the freeway, center lane of a 3 lane highway. the vehicle to my left began to move into my lane. i had to quickly move to my right, activating my lane departure and steering assist. this caused my vehicle to attempt to move me back into my lane (where the other driver was now trying to occupy!). i was shown how to disable this feature if desired but what i wasn't told by the dealer, is that this feature can no longer be set to default to off. i just finished a lease of a 2018 toyota rav4 which also had this feature but once i disabled it, it was disabled unless i re-enabled it. with this new vehicle, when you disable this feature, it's only disabled until you turn off the vehicle. when the vehicle is turned on again, this feature is set back to active. i checked with the dealers service department and they said that this is how this feature will work moving forward, that you can no longer set it to off as the default setting.

"during last trip with car, parked car while shopping. when leaving store car lost steering and warning light came on in dash indicating power steering assist fault. car was extremely difficult to drive after that. waiting for appointment with dealer. had this happened while turning at a busy intersection it could have been a problem. car has 100,000 miles so i expect some problems, but i think this could be a safety issue."
the steering assist shut off mid drive while turning off the highway and almost got killed by hitting the divider in the center

unknown. system failed to warn me that a car was approaching on my blind spot and if i had the warning it could have prevented an accident. had a warning been given allowing me to know not to cross the lane i would have been more aware of the car approaching my lane and then the automatic emergency braking system couldâve kicked in to prevent this accident from happening in the first place.
i purchased the car in april of 2021 and by the end of the month it was in the shop because it was consuming way to much fuel iâve been back to the dealer since for this matter many times as well as many time for other safety defects like the lane keeping assist taking over and forcing me into opposite lanes of traffic and my finance manager noticed that the vehicle was mile jumping. i have been back for the above mentioned issues and safety concerns and the only response i have gotten so far is that the vehicle is operating as designed and final do not come back you are causing unnecessary problems and issues 
"1. the infotainment system crashed (happens often), which caused the touchscreen in the center control stack to turn black and become unresponsive. this also caused the eyesight safety system, adaptive cruise control (with lane keep assist), and reverse auto braking to all shut down (my dashboard lit up with warning lights and errors).  2. not only is this an annoyance, but having all of the safety systems in my car unexpectedly shut down is extremely unsafe, especially adaptive cruise control. other functions of my car, such as the radio and climate controls are also inaccessible when this happens.  3. a subaru dealer has replaced the touchscreen in my vehicle to try and remedy the slowness and crashing, but it did not seem to fix anything. my car safety systems have not shut down prior to this incident, but on this day (june 6th), they did when the system crashed, which was after the replacement. after waiting weeks to get a replacement which didn't fix anything, i felt as if i needed to go elsewhere for help with this issue.  4. only the manufacturer has inspected this issue, and i've also emailed subaru directly after this incident, as to which i have not gotten a response yet (emailed on monday, june 7th).  5. the warning lamps (for eyesight, reverse auto breaking, and adaptive cruise control) all appeared on my dashboard as soon as the infotainment system crashed on june 6th. prior to this, my vehicle had no warning lamps. they went away a few minutes after the system rebooted (all while i was driving on the highway), and system functionality returned to normal.  other notes: this vehicle only has about 15k miles on it, and is only 1 year and 3 months old. issues like this should not be happening. before the replacement of the touchscreen, i had issues with it being extremely laggy and crashing, but my car's safety systems never shut down before. this is a new issue, which prompted me to report it to nhtsa."

"wiper failure when set to automatic (rain-sensing) when vision system shut down due to poor visibility.  a little background: i've been driving for 50+ years, about 1.5m total miles, most of it commuting.  i'm a software engineer with 45+ years of experience, mostly in embedded systems.  problem drive: most settings, including headlights and wipers, on auto.  autopilot was on.   drove into a heavy rainstorm, auto wipers worked well, speeding up until they were on high.   traffic speed dropped from 70+ to less than 35 due to rain.  drove into a band of torrential rain.  saw a pop-up on the screen that said something like autopilot turning off due to diminished visibility.  autopilot (speed control) then turned off.  then the wipers shut off.  let's see, guy designing vision system:  can't figure out anything from camera images, so let's warn user and shut off stuff that relies on the camera.  like autopilot.  wipers?  leave them in the last state?  nah, turn off the enable signal to the auto wiper state, too.  torrential downpour, almost no visibility, and my wipers just shut off.  i frantically kept pressing the wiper button on the turn signal stalk to force a couple of swipes and force the wiper pop-up menu, then take my eyes off the road with possibly someone stopping right in front of me (yes, i slowed down) to do hand-eye coordination on the wiper pop-up to hit the manual setting full speed button!  related to tesla model s/x recall for touchscreen failure disabling defog/defrost.  proper design requires hard controls (not just touchscreen) for safety-critical items, like lights, wipers, defog/defrost.  that's why a hard control for hazard flashers is required.  i've spent years designing life-critical medical systems.  they all have hazard mitigation matrix sections - analyze possible fault modes, assign chance of happening and severity of impact if they happen, then have a mitigation strategy.  this seems to be a system design flaw"
i was driving in town at a speed of 35 mph when my car suddenly applied the brakes very hard and nearly stopped the vehicle. a warning alarm sounded at the same time. there were no other vehicles or objects within several blocks of my vehicle. i took the vehicle to honda on grand in elmhurst il where i purchased it new on 7-20-19 and reported the problem. they inspected the vehicle and could not find a problem. i looked online to find many people are having the exact same problem with this model. from what i read it appears to be a software problem with the adaptive cruise control. honda is not acknowledging any problem at this time. my vehicle has 9480 miles on it and has never been in an accident. this is a serious safety issue and could easily cause an accident!

"i am writing to inform you of the following problems with the steering system of my 2017 subaru forester: 1) when turning or changing car lanes, the steering wheel does not engage the wheels until the steering wheel is turned to about a 90 degree angle in the direction of the turn, left or right, 2) after making a turn, it takes more rotations of the steering wheel to come out of the turn than it took to make the turn. at other times it takes more rotations of the steering wheel to make the turn than it does to come out of the turn, 3) constant adjustments to steering have to be made in order to stay in a lane regardless of whether the lane is straight or curved. it's like trying to maneuver a boat on water or like driving on a frictionless surface. it feels like the car switches to a different control system, either void of any driver control, or delayed response to driver input, and 4) the steering wheel has to be turned to almost a 90 degree angle before it engages the wheels while the car is running and stationary.  with the exception of item 4, the steering problems occur when there are other cars in the vicinity of our car. on secluded roads our car drives fine, so far. the steering issues occur during city and highway driving. the steering problems occur even when the following car assistive technologies are all set to off: automatic braking, hill assist, lane change assist, x-mode, eyesight, and cruise control.  on may 4, 2021, we took the car to the subaru superstore of chandler in arizona. we showed the dealership a video of item 4 and they observed it. they described it as ""egregious"". the dealership stated that they could not find a reason for item 4 and they could not duplicate the other problems. they stated that they documented the problem.  having an unresponsive/delayed response steering system could prove disastrous when seconds count to avert a disaster. this has been an ongoing problem since october 2018, with no resolution from subaru."
"i bought the car july of last year (2020) and noticed the car was a bit jerky when i accelerated from a complete stop. but as i started to drive the car more i noticed it was jerky shifting from 2nd to 3rd gears. its a violent jerk. everyone in the car whiplashes when it happens. when i go downhill and press on the brakes to slow down it gets a sudden burst of speed and doesn't slow down but goes faster even when pushing on the brake. on the dashboard i have multiple lights that won't turn off. the lane keeping assistance, lane departure warning, forward collision warning as well. i havent gone to the dealership or have had checked out by acura or anyone just yet. but i know other people have the same exact problems and its a real danger to drive and these things happen on a daily basis. im sure its something with the transmission and something needs to happen because i love this car and worried about safety of me and others out on the road"

"ongoing problem with an intermittent steering issue.  the problem is that this is an intermittent issue and hard to get to dealer during time of concern, and while they could troubleshoot the issue before the issue fixes itself.   the concern always happens upon starting vehicle.  never happens when you are already going and issue is not present.  steering wheel will pull right, or left, upon start up, and then at some point it fixes itself and problem is no longer an issue.  could happen at any time upon start up, cold or hot weather, fresh start, or going back out after having been on road already, just no rhyme or reason for it.    the safety issue is that when turning, when it is pulling, is that it pulls you towards the curb/shoulder, or towards oncoming traffic.  additionally, it will also not return the wheel after a turn, so if it was pulling left, and you are turning left for example, you have to manually get that wheel back or it'll just keep going left.    i've experimented with turning off lane keep assist, lane centering (cruise control), put it in different modes like trail, sport, etc. and even stopped on the shoulder, and tried to re-start the vehicle.  nothing can stop it consistently.  and it fixes itself within a 10 minute period.  i have checked the awd monitor screen to see if a wheel is pulling harder than the others based on the display of power going to wheels, no luck.   it has been doing this since day one.  not every trip.  not even every week.  sometimes it could happen 5x in a week, and sometimes it could be 2 weeks before it happens again and then again in another couple of weeks.  not the road either.  must be paying attention when starting out because it could happen on any trip, during a trip if stopping and re-starting vehicle while on a trip, etc. because it can/will pull you.  i have a video, albeit hard to really see much but shows car pulling.  also note this is not a torque steer because it could happen on acceleration or not.

"a different problem that involves steering is when using speed control (cruise control).  i only have attempted this while on the pa turnpike at faster speeds, or a highway with a higher speed limit, but when engaging speed control with lane centering assistance, vehicle will sometimes pull you too close to the left side of your lane.  in some cases, it will almost appear to others you are drunk as it is working to keep you centered in your lane, but at times it will just pull you to the left side of your lane, so close to others that traffic will beep and i'll want to poop my pants, because it harder to pull back to center when this is doing the steering for you in cruise control mode.  have turned off lane center assist and the speed control works fine, including slowing you down as traffic slows.  but with lane center assist on, and using cruise control, this is when erratic behavior exists.  dealer could not duplicate the issue - would require taking this on a fast moving highway, like the pa turnpike, and hope it happens while out on that trip.  does not always do it, and have to been able to figure out why it does it (i.e. double yellow line vs. white intermittent line).    when it happens, it puts you too close to traffic next to you and could cause other vehicles to either impact with you or make them swerve out of the way thinking you are coming into their lane.  very serious when it happens, moving at high rate of speed, and lane centering when using speed control is very strong and harder to override vs. the small bump it gives you when not using speed control and too close to the shoulder for example.  that lane correction works well, albeit a bit weak to correct.    has happened since new, august 2020.  and continues to happen sporadically.    "
"the lane keep assistant (lka) as implemented is a severe safety flaw.  the lka only take input from lane markers on the road but fails to consider other issues such as other vehicles or construction.  several times on my most recent drive on interstate highways at 70-80 mph i was passing large semi trucks. the trucks drifted out of their lane and into my lane.  i took emergency evasive action to steer my vehicle out of the way of the semi truck but the lane keep assistant (lka) noticed i was out of my lane and aggressively steered my vehicle back into the other vehicle.  luckily i did not hit the other vehicle but the lka made avoiding other vehicles more difficult and could contribute to a collision if the driver is not foreful enough to both steer out of the way of danger and to counter the steering control of the lka. 1. this feature should not be allowed on vehicles as implemented. in my 30 years of the driving this is the most dangerous feature i have ever experienced.  my vehicle is trying to kill me!!   2. this feature should have the ability to be set to ""off"" permanently or tied to a driver's profile settings to remain off while that driver is in control. drivers should not have to remember to turn off the feature manually every time the car is started. 3. driver's should have the ability to turn off steering control but still have the lane departure warning signal."
"lane assist and forward collision warning would intermittently turn off along with the passenger window automatically going down. vehicle would also seems to glitch and restart at the same time. after this taking place for a couple of weeks, now the vehicle has twice completely shut off while driving. the engine, screens, dash, etc. all turned off and the it was automatically put into park. vehicle will restart and everything seems back to normal once it is restarted.

"component failed: unanticipated without warning complete engine power failure, loss of steering assist, abs braking system failure, electrical gages on dash erratic.  the vehicle is available for inspection at anytime. safety: the event has occurred seven(7) times between 7/24/2020 and 6/17/2021 while traveling at highway speeds on major expressways and highways.  the loss of engine power, steering assist and abs caused high risk while controlling the vehicle to a stop or failure in an active traffic lane of an expressway or highway created a crash hazard.  one property damage accident was caused with two unrelated vehicles avoiding a collision with our suddenly disabled vehicle. problem confirmed/inspected:  between 7/24/2020 the vehicle has been towed or taken to two ford dealerships; cain ford commerce georgia and jacky jones ford cleveland georgia.  also serviced by two independent shops in georgia and michigan.  several calls to ford engineering hotline mr. karl griffs.    the dash rpm indicator become erratic and then all gages and warning lights come on the engine fails and loss of steering and abs braking."
"the lane assist and crosswind assist do not work properly.  when a gust of wind hits you or when you're passing a semi, the van immediately forces your vehicle off the road or into the other lane where there is another vehicle or a concrete barrier. it's very difficult to hold onto the steering wheel and try to maneuver the vehicle to stay in your lane.  the only way to turn off these features are to turn off them off every time you start your vehicle.  mercedes benz has told me there is no way to turn it off completely and they have had numerous complaints of unsafe vehicle responses from the assist features."

"vehicle veering constantly while lane keeping assistance is engaged causing persistent swerving and inviding adjacent lanes as well as requiring additional distraction while system is engaged. adaptive cruise control erratically and some times violently applies  brakes, causing the following vehicles to constantly apply their brakes to avoid rear collision with the ridgeline."
"when car restarts after being in auto stop start mode the steering wheel jerks uncontrollably.  the car obviously has a suspension problem.  dealership failed to repair issue properly after several attempts.  also appears dealer made false diagnosis to prevent repairs under bumper to bumper warranty. gm dealer also refused to repair issue under power train warranty. another dealer wanted $555 just to check issue.    a couple of weeks ago i suddenly lost control of the vehicle. i was at a red light.  car went into auto stop start mode.  when light changed and car restarted, as i proceeded to take off the steering wheel jerked away from my hands, and i lost control of the wheel and car.   luckily it was a single turning lane and no other vehicle was next to me turning.  i pulled off side of the road in shock.  i drove about half mile and warning light displayed on dash.  warning message states steering assist reduced drive with care""  what was a brand new 2018 chevrolet malibu purchased in 2019 is now unsafe and inoperable.  this steering component issue along with several others were brought to dealerships attention and were not acknowledged and were dismissed.   after several other failed attempts this dealership purposely ignored this issue months ago while car was still under bumper to bumper warranty.  dealership also refused to repair this issue under powertrain warranty.  2018 chevy malibu has had 5 recalls to my knowledge.  this has been spontaneously producing white smoke from underneath the hood on several occasions. i have video and witnesses.  this car was sold as a brand new car.  this car had recalls at the time of purchase and never disclosed the recall information.    also be advised that i cranked the car today just to keep the battery in tack because car has been sitting since june 10.  the car choked, head lights went flickering,  car could barely stay on.  it appears to be an engine issue.  these cars should not be on the road.  they are not safe."

"vw lane assist is on when the vehicle is turned on. it must be turned off by the driver which i forget to do. driving on country two lanes i've encountered joggers, bikers in the designated bike lane, service vehicles on the right shoulder. when i give them some extra room to avoid them the active lane assist steers the car towards the people i'm trying to avoid. if the road is pitched enough the lane assist steering is rather abrupt. there is no feature that allows lane assist to be disabled and manually re-enabled when needed. the best solution would be to allow lane assist only when the active cruise control is active.

"i have a 2017 honda crv with 1.5 turbo with only 89,651 miles.  when we started the vehicle every warning light on the dash was on , including parking brake, lane departure, forward collision warning, lane keeping assist . so we didn't know if it was safe to even drive the car home.  so i had to have a family member bring a code reader so i i could see if we could drive it home. it only had 3 codes, p0302 cylinder 2 misfire dtc severity 2 of 3, p0302 cylinder 2 misfire detected and another p0302 cylinder misfire. had no codes of all the warning lights that were flashing on the dash.  i cleared the codes with the code reader and all warning lights went off. so we drove it home.  the next day we sent it to a honda dealer and they performed a software update and a air-fuel test on all 4 cylinders. the vehicle did fail air-fuel test. the honda dealer recommends new fuel injectors at a cost of $ 1264.00 . i feel there is a defect in the fuel injectors if they only lasted 89,650 miles. also honda might have a software problem if bad fuel injectors makes all the warning lights go on ."

"automatic cruise control (autopilot) has twice failed to decrease speed when it should have. the vehicle will also brake at a moderate to high rate on the highway with zero warning or message, with no obstacle or vehicle on the road, creating a dangerous situation with following vehicles.   acc also requires the use of automatic wipers and automatic high beams, both of which activate at random times and thus encourage their disuse (e.g. sunny clear day, or with obvious traffic in front of the vehicle, respectively). automatic high beams turning on and flashing when they shouldn't is unsafe for other drivers.    finally, the use automatic wipers and high beams is not listed as a requirement for active safety features such as fcw and aeb to function. however, these two critical safety systems rely on the same camera array and systems with problematic functionality described above. it's hard to believe that these actual safety systems, listed as a feature of the vehicle, are able to function as required when the full array of sensors and logic, shared with autopilot, are unable to perform reliably.

"van has just over 5k miles. multiple warnings occurred while at speed on a highway. primary warning was 'low brake power' and braking became extremely touchy as it seemed to utilize the emergency brake as a backup. this extreme braking is hazardous and could result in an accident caused by braking too quickly - with a possible rear-end collision by traffic to the rear. additional warnings/malfunctions were listed as well, due to the low brake power: lta malfunction (lane keep assist), automatic emergency brake malfunction, parking brake malfunction, check engine. there were no symptoms of poor braking prior to the incident.  dealer filed a tas report with toyota to address the problem, and was subsequently inspected by the toyota field representative. initially could not duplicate/identify the issue and the van was returned. within one week the incident reoccurred, again on the highway. van is currently with the dealer and the brake booster and brake master cylinder will be replaced. expect the dealer will retain the parts."
"kia's manual gives instructions on two different ways (having two is a bit odd) to disengage their adaptive cruise control (kia's name for it is smart cruise control).  neither works.  it is not possible to disengage scc and use regular cruise control.  this has been brought to the attention of the dealer from where the car was purchased (who has been working with us non-stop) as well as by me to kia via their website.  the dealer's service department has inspected it and cannot find a way to disengage the scc.  (other safety features built into the car can be turned off).  kia is balking at finding a fix. i cannot use cruise control in this car without also accepting the scc feature.  i find it dangerous unless it is what i want engaged.  i prefer to be in control of my vehicle and do not want the car adjusting my speed for me.  if i'm approaching a vehicle and signal to pass, but first get to close to the vehicle i wish to pass according to the vehicle's software, the car slows down as i move into a passing lane.  even if i have plenty of room for someone who may already be in that lane, my vehicle slowing down until the camera and software determine it's 'safe' again poses a problem.  i can give other examples, but am sure you get the idea.   suffice to say, other brands of vehicles have a way to disengage adaptive cruise control features.  kia's manual states it can be disengaged, but as stated, those directions do not work.  kia needs to make this right.  since i need to give a date next, please realize this has been ongoing since our purchase on april 30, 2021."

"in early 2012 i started to notice that when the weather was cold my steering wheel would shudder as i backed out of my driveway. after a the initial wheel turn the problem would disappear until the next day, or week. throughout the years the problem has gotten worse to the point that the power steering failed all together for 3 months in late 2013. inexplicably the power steering returned in early 2014, but if the temperature was cold the steering was very heavy for a few degrees of turning and then the car would sense i had turned the wheel a few degrees and would then assist too much and the vehicle would jerk in that direction.  as the year progressed the problem changed to a constant shake back and forth when i first started the vehicle. this issue would happen at speeds ranging from 0-10mph and only when either initiating a turn or while unwinding the wheel from a turn. i have had problems in the past couple of months, as the temperature has fallen again, when driving straight and entering a gradual curve in the road (travelling at any speed) the wheel will not give power steering assist and the wheel is very difficult to turn (compared to if power assist was working correctly) and then after a couple of degrees the assist will jump in and the car quickly over corrects and vehicle veers in the direction of the steer necessitating immediate correction in the opposite direction.  there appear to be many complaints from a loyal mazda fan base about this exact issue, and how several people have nearly had an accident, but there has been no response from mazda. there seems to be no exact fix issued, not even a service bulletin."

"i submitted a complaint on february 2, 2015 in reference to the steering column locking up while driving my car to work.  the car was towed to the repair shop and the service technician informed me that the codes were cleared and the car was tested and was drivable.  he also told me that i would have to replace the steering column at the cost of $2,600.  it was my understanding that after the recall repair was made back in august 2014, that there should be no other issues pertaining to the electronic steering assist or torque sensor module.  after doing some research and reading a letter dated july 1, 2014 pertaining to safety recall 14s05 from  the office of [xxx], director of service engineering operations, this letter instructed dealerships to ""reprogram the power steering control module if no code was present, replace the torque sensor if code b2278 was present or replace the steering column assembly if code b1342 or b2277 is present"".  what the reprogramming of the power steering control module actually did was to program the steering column sensor to illuminate the wrench icon on the dashboard to let the driver know that the power steering assist was about to be disabled on the vehicle. this is still a safety issue!  this is not a fix!  when the vast majority of drivers take their vehicle to the dealership to be repaired, that is what they expect.  the sick part of this reprogramming the module is that once this notification is made, the car is inoperable and ford wants you to bring the truck back to the dealership to have that same steering issue repaired at your cost for $2,600. it is still a safety issue that ford should have fixed, not reprogrammed your car to notify you that your power steering is about to disable. a recall should be issued to replace the steering columns on all 2008 ford escapes that experience this issue. that was a quick fix    information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6).  *tr"

"i own a 2012 prius with the technology package, including radar adaptive cruise control. i believe these same radar sensors are also used to detect imminent collisions in front of the vehicle, even when cruise control mode is not engaged.     about a month ago, while driving north on interstate 5 in downtown seattle at approximately 60 miles per hour, and without cruise control engaged, my prius went into ""imminent collision mode"" despite the fact that there was nothing in front of me -- no vehicles, no debris, no obstructions. before slamming on the brakes, my seat belt was ""tightened"" and the brakes were automatically applied at full force, even without my foot touching the brake. this was incredibly jarring and disturbing, and could have been a serious accident if there was a vehicle behind me. fortunately, there was no vehicle behind me at this time. after about two seconds of full braking, the vehicle ""disengaged"" collision mode and allowed me proceed and return to speed.     i called the toyota of seattle dealership and spoke to their service department. they were unaware of this issue, and suggested that i bring the vehicle in for servicing. they confirmed there were no outstanding recalls on the vehicle. they told me it would cost at least $100 for a basic diagnostic, and if sensors had to be replaced, it could cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars. because i am currently unemployed and looking for work, i did not bring my vehicle into the service center. i feel this is toyota's obligation to fix, and shouldn't require me spending money out of pocket.     i would like some kind of response from toyota on this issue. i have avoided using the radar cruise control since this moment, but the fact that it occurred while not in this mode makes me feel that the car could ""take control"" at any moment and cause an accident.     thanks,    [xxx]    information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6)   *js"

under recall 14s05 the electronic steering assist was updated but did not fix the defect. the recall only gives a chime and warning that steering is going to fail. the chime went off but didn't give the warning on the instrument cluster until i went to the dealer to see what the chime was. when i was driving down the freeway at 70 mph my steering started to shake and the vehicle began to vibrate. i can only imagine if this were to totally fail while traveling at that speed.   *tr

"i started receiving a power steering assist failure warning light, and loss of power steering, about a week before it failed completely.  each time i was in a parking lot and reset the warning light by turning off the car and turning it back on.  i was pulling out of the driveway on friday march 6th, 2015 when the light came back on, and i lost power steering in the vehicle.  due to the vehicle not being operable on the road, i had it towed to the local ford dealership.  they diagnosed the issue as a steering rack module failure and suggested a replacement of the steering rack.  we ended up having them replace it and the total bill was over $1,700.00.  the dealership stated that this is a common problem with this specific model year and car and had this part in stock.  a simple internet search also shows that many other cars with this specific model year have the same issue.  please look into issuing a recall as losing power steering could potentially be dangerous if driving the car on a highway.  *tr"
"i had taken my vehicle in for the recall #14s05, in 2014; it was fixed in a matter of 2 hours. after that my steering was very flexible and very loose, which i thought i would have to get used to. then within a few months the steering column started to tremble while in park or with applied brake. i thought it was front end issues, which i took to the shop and found nothing wrong. a month went by and while driving on the highway on march 9, 2015 going about 60mph with my 5 year old great niece in the car, the power steering went out. it took all my strength to keep it from crashing. i noticed on the dashboard that it read ?power steering assist fault?. immediately i thought to myself; i took this in for the recall, why is this happening. i made it to a safe place and called the ford dealer and explain everything to them. they said that they wouldn't know if it is related or not until they run a diagnostic. later that next day they call and said that it is not related to the software that was replace, which i disagree, and they quoted me a large amount to fix. i told them that it is ford responsibility because i feel that it was related to the recall. i could had died and my great niece as well. this is not acceptable. i had to pay for tow and diagnostic and the problem still not fix and i still feel strongly that its ford responsibility. when a recall is performed and the problem still happened then it's no accuse or denying that it is indeed a recall issue. this has cause mental stress, loss of wages, mental stress due to avoiding an accident and keeping me and my great niece out of danger. this issue needs to be address and fixed, before something like this happens to someone else. whether or not the recall was done it did not perform like it should have and it caused a danger.this needs to be addressed immediately.  thank you.  *tr"

"i have experienced multiple instances of losing power steering both while stationary and driving. the car generates a ""power steering assist fault"" and ""service power steering now"" error message. often after turning off the car and restarting (sometimes taking several times), the fault will clear and the car operates again normally; however, this has recurred at least 3-4 times in the four years i have owned the car. this also occurs while driving, which would present a significant safety hazard for someone unlike myself who does not have prior experience with manual steering vehicles that can adjust on the fly. when taken to the dealer for diagnosis/assistance several times, i am told they cannot diagnose it unless it is actively showing the error code (which is not feasible as the codes clear after the car is turned off, and typically would require either a tow to a dealership or the ability to drive straight to a ford facility at the precise time the incident occurs, without turning the car off at any point) and thus it does not get addressed or fixed. i have read several other reviews of others having the same issue with this same make and model, and many have resulted in highly costly recommendations for repair which do not fix the problem. i see that nhtsa currently has an investigation ongoing regarding this same issue, and as such wanted to ensure i did my part by formally documenting another instance of this problem, as i felt ford's report that it is an isolated incident only affecting 3 in 1000 cars seems highly questionable given the extent of others reporting the same failures in a limited number of these cars of the same model year sold, and those being limited only to those (unlike myself, up until this juncture) who elected to take the time to enter an internet complaint.  *tr"

"            upon purchase of a new 2015 tahoe i observed the possibility of a problem with the forward collision alert system (fca). i reported this to the service manager at chevrolet. on 9 april 2015 the service manager, assistant service manager, master technician, and i took the vehicle for a test drive. while driving the vehicle at moderate highway speeds i demonstrated the various phases and operation of vehicle detection. the fca has plenty of sensitivity and detects vehicles in excess of the specified distance in the owner's manual which is not an issue. at a moderate closing rate between vehicles the instrument cluster icon changes from green to amber-orange which appears nominal. however, the red alarm heads-up windshield display, rapid high-pitched beeps and red icon are never activated until a closing distance about ~3 feet before a collision. there is virtually zero reaction time for a driver to brake the vehicle at less than one car length before going to red. in addition, the system is supposed to disengage the adaptive cruise control (acc). considering time, rate, and distance this is ineffective as the mass and kinetic energy also needs to fully disengage before a potential collision. because of the danger of creating a traffic incident the vehicle was not tested to the level of a full collision. i was informed by the service manager that there are no service bulletins, adjustments, or software patches that may correct this deficiency by the dealer. gm stated that the system works as designed and delivered.    the gm forward collision alarm (fca) delivered product appears to have a design deficiency and is an operational safety hazard waiting to happen. if the fca does not function properly then why introduce it to a consumer regardless of gm owner manual warnings about trusting alert systems.  *tr"

"i received a recall notice a while ago and took my car in right away for the software fix. not long after that, i started having problems where the power steering intermittently didn't seem to be working. 2 weeks ago i took it to the dealer to be checked. they said they found no problem. 7 days later i got in my car and immediately got a power steering assist fault error on the dashboard and couldn't turn the steering wheel. i had it towed to the dealership but once it was there, the power steering was working fine. now, 5 days later, my car is still there and the only thing they keep telling me is that they have not been able to replicate the problem so they can't do anything. i sent the service rep a link to multiple websites where many people have had this exact same problem which can only be repaired by replacing the steering gear assembly but they made it clear that they won't fix it until they see it happen for themselves even though they retrieved the error code from the diagnostics in the car.      i contacted a ford rep directly and got an email message from the regional rep who also said that if the dealership cannot replicate the problem there is no repair.  so, unless it happens again while they have it i'll have to just drive it and hope that when it does happen again it isn't in a situation that injures me or a member of my family.  also, if it does happen again while i'm driving but doesn't go out permanently it doesn't matter because they'll only fix it if it happens to them no matter what codes are present in the system.  so it appears that intermittent loss of power steering is ok for ford since they'll only repair it if they experience it no matter what the car diagnostics say!  how many ford owners are on the road now just waiting for their power steering to go completely out? how is this a safe policy? i shouldn't be afraid to drive my car!!!  *tr"

"i purchased a new 2014 jeep grand cherokee srt last year and have had many issues, this has to do with the automatic braking system. i was in the far left turn lane of a two lane left turn stoplight.  stoplight turns green for left turn lanes to proceed to highway entrance ramp, as i am turning left my car automatically slams into a full brake and stops in middle of turn lane.  the car was out of my control as the brake peddle was fully pressed to the floor without me touching the brake.  my vehicle does have the automatic brake system, which was activated this day.  the car behind me slammed on their brakes since my vehicle came to a complete stop in the middle of making a left turn.  we did not get rear ended thankfully.  there was a car to the right of my vehicle also making a left turn, at no point did this vehicle come near my vehicle nor crossed lanes.  my vehicle came to a complete stop for no reason and when i went to press on the gas pedal, it continued to stay in a full brake, it took about a minute to get my vehicle to start accelerating again.  after this incident i turned off the automatic brake system.  to be driving a vehicle and then out of nowhere the car takes control of itself is very scary and not safe."
"on multiple occasions while using the adaptive cruise control the vehicle will suddenly and unexpectedly apply the brakes when the path is clear in front of the vehicle.  it would appear large objects such as a jersey barrier (common in wa) the left and large slowing traffic (a potential danger) to the right will trigger the inappropriate action and results in a dangerous situation to vehicles behind!  the situation that causes the problem is not easy to reproduce, hence its surprise!"
"driving 2010 ford fusion sel v6 home at night at around 70 mph, suddenly message came up ""advance track , service power steering now"".  we had seen this message before.  this is the fifth occurrence.  the vehicle maintains its steering ability (going 70 mph), but upon arrival at our destination, and the shut off of the engine, all power-steering assist is lost.  this has happened five times before.  the ford dealer can clear all of the error messages and the car will have its power steering ability again; however, when the ford mechanic diagnosed the error messages and the problem, his solution was to replace the electrical rack and pinion steering assist at a cost of $1200 plus labor.  i declined, as i am sure that the problem will recur.  how do i get rid of this car?  how can i sell it and not declare its ugly persistent problem??  why doesn't ford act on this?  the mechanic stated that he didn't know of any other cars with this problem.

"on saturday, june 6, 2015, my 2014 toyota sienna limited automatically brake with very significant force while the cruise control was engaged at approximately 45 mph.  no vehicles or obstacles were ahead and i was driving on a straight and relatively level street that has a 45 mph speed limit.     this problem also occurred many, many times in the first several months after purchasing this vehicle new in april 2014.  i reported this problem to molle toyota, kansas city, missouri when it first happened and at the 5,000 and 10,000 services and they could find no problems with the adaptive cruise control system.  during the first few months of ownership i tried driving to the molle toyota dealership when the problem occurred and the dealership was open but each time the problem stopped happening before i got to the dealership.    the problem usually happens ""out of the blue"" after i have been driving for a while.  once the problem first occurs, it then happens over and over each time i reengage the cruise control. stopping the vehicle and restarting the engine almost always stops the problem from recurring.  and as i indicated above, sometimes the problem will stop on its own without restarting the engine.     i am submitting this complaint at this time after seeing in the news that there have been similar complaints on jeeps.  the june 6 incident was also much worse than previous incidents due to another car following very closely behind me when the sienna brakes automatically slammed on.  i was also concerned that the driver behind me might have thought that i had braked hard on purpose.    i have been able to cope with this problem but my main concern is with allowing others to drive the sienna and that they may not be able to quickly turn the cruise control off when the problem happens.   *tr"
"started the vehicle and noticed that parksense and forward collision warning were not working and every few minutes, the instrument panel, would beep and often display an error message. the messages it displayed were, ""service shifter"" (displayed most often), ""park sense off"" (it would automatically turn on and off) and ""acc/fcw not working service required"" (displayed a few times). also, the screen (instrument panel) would flicker a few times and beep.the forward collision warning sensor did not work, regular cruise control did not work, adaptive cruise control did not work and parking sensors did not work.    i brought it to the dealership and it appears that the acc ball (radar/camera/the thing that looks like the eye ball on the front bumper) had corrosion and all wires were shot. they ordered a new piece with harness and will replace it.  however, it is my concern that this is a major electrical issue. the water can easily get into the harness (rain/snow/car wash). it should be still under warranty but what is the solution after the warranty is over? it looks like it needs to be replaced every 16,000 miles (approx.)"
"car notified me of an issue while i was driving. it said power steering assist fault. i was going approximately 45mph. i noticed that the power steering was not working. i was able to make it home, but it was very difficult. when i turned my car off and on again at home, the steering started working again. i haven't had a chance to try it again, but i heard it may be a daily occurance that this goes out. i called my dealership and they said they cannot help me yet because the recall is not officially available.

i was driving on a side street at about 15 mph when i noticed it became difficult to steer the car. the steering assist warning light came on. it was now difficult to make turns. it felt like manual steering from the 1960's. there was no warning; it just happened. i took the ford focus to my mechanic. he plugged the car into the computer for a diagnostic report. he found nothing wrong with it. he loosened the battery cables and made a few other inspections. the steering assist light was no longer on and the car ran well. having the power steering go out without warning was scary. i've never had this problem with any car.  *tr

"my wife was driving home from work when suddenly she experienced a loss of power steering in her vehicle. after trying to keep from being in an accident she was able to pull her 2010 ford fusion into a parking lot.  after she turned into the parking lot she turned off the vehicle and let it sit for a few seconds then she restarted the vehicle and she was able to proceed a little further.  then it happened for a second time.  once again she turned the ignition off, let it sit for a few moments then restarted the vehicle.  she was able to drive a little further until it once again happened as she was turning into our driveway.    on the morning of saturday 6/13/2015 i went out to the vehicle and started it up and tried to back it out of our dive way when the service the advance trac system message appeared.  i turned the vehicle off the restarted the vehicle and then a different message appeared.  this time it was the service power steering assist message. i then turned off the vehicle and contacted the local ford dealer and was told that it was a common problem with the fusion and that i would need to schedule an appointment to have the power steering rac replaced and it would cost around $1,800 to replace. i told the man that was ridiculous for a vehicle that has only 56,787 miles on it.    i have researched this and have found that many other owners have experienced this same issue.  i feel that this is a major safety issue and if it was not for my wife's quick thinking she may have been involved in an accident.     please research this issue before it happens to someone else and unfortunately cost someone their life.    please feel free to contact me anytime for additional information.

"i have a 09 tiguan. the power steering failure first happened when i was driving from seattle to spokane, wa. it's a 300-mile, 5-hour drive. i stopped about half way at a rest stop and when i restarted the car again, the steering wheel started shaking rapidly back and forth. then the red light of power steering assist failure came on. i restarted the car several more times, but the problem continued. so i had to drive the car without power steering. fortunately the road is pretty much straight from that point on. just imagine what if the power steering failed when the car's still running. when i reached spokane, it was kinds late. my plan was to  get the car to a dealer first thing next day, but when i started the car the next day, the problem disappeared and it didn't happen again during my 5-day stay in spokane. however, when i drove the car back to seattle, the same problem appeared again. i finally took the car to a vw dealer. they told me they found the problem stored in steering rack and in order to fix this, the whole steering rack needed to be replaced. the job was quoted about $1,900. also the dealer thinks vw needs to at least cover part of the fix, so they filed the paperwork. but vw denied any kind of coverage. i ended up paying for everything. after searching online, i found dozens of other tiguan owners who have experienced the same problem. i'm no car expert, but this is a very serious safety issue with the tiguan and can even be a design flaw from vw. vw needs to put this problem into its recall list asap!  p.s. i found a youtube video showing the exact same problem of the power steering failure.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dz-1u8twvc. . . .updated 07-16-15 *bf  updated  9/21/2015*js  "

"while driving using adaptive cruise control  the car seems to hesitate for a second, drop into a lower gear and the top speed is limited - the check engine and the traction control warning lights go on.  a message also appears saying ""fcw off"", and the acc will not work. turning the engine off and restarting removes all indications of the problems except for the check engine light, which goes off eventually. was able to get to a dealer with the check engine light on and was told that the light went out while testing, other time they could not find any problems, but updated software and replaced a switch. this seems to happen on long trips and much to my personnel concerns when i'm in the left lane on the interstate with traffic when the car conks out."
"tl* the contact owns a 2007 buick rendezvous. while driving approximately 60 mph, the power steering assist light illuminated and the vehicle stalled. the vehicle was merged to the side of the road where it was restarted. the failure recurred intermittently. the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. the manufacturer was not notified of the failure. the failure mileage was 84,000.

"traction control needs service message displayed, then throttle disabled message displayed shutting the engine off going down the road. so therefor no power steering, brakes etc . once pulled onto shoulder  car would not crank. had to wait five minutes until the gauges flickered and then car was able to be restarted. this is highly dangerous if not where to pull off or being followed closely. not to mention not power steering assist or brake assist. this could very easily cause a crash and there for should be a recall issued before people are injured or killed by this!  "
"while driving with the adaptive cruise control engaged the vehicle braked itself hard extremely slowing the car down on the highway. there were no cars in front or in other lanes when this happened. had a car been following me i would most likely been rear ended.took the vehicle to the dealer and, after checking out the vehicle, they indicated that they could not duplicate the problem, that the software was up to date, and that the acc system is ""working as designed."" this is a major safety issue that under different circumstances could have resulted in a serious accident with injuries or worse.

"this issue happens often. it has happened in neutral, first and second gears. i will either be stationary or driving and the power steering assist will fail and throw up a fault on my dash. at that point it is impossible to turn the steering wheel causing me to not be able to control the car."
"the truck is equipped with adaptive cruise control and collision alert systems.  intermittently, when traveling at interstate speeds with the adaptive cruise control activated and passing tractor-trailer sized vehicles, the adaptive cruise control will falsely sense another vehicle directly in front and activate the brake system, resulting in rapid deceleration of the truck and creating the potential for a collision from behind.  when the system activates, there are no other vehicles in front of the truck, only in the adjacent lane.  this has happened over half a dozen times, and has resulted in near rear-end collisions from vehicles behind the truck because of how rapidly the adaptive cruise control slows the truck.  passengers in the truck have been thrown into their seatbelts from the rapid deceleration of the truck.   luckily no one has been hurt, but this presents an extreme safety problem and has resulted in having to turn off the adaptive cruise control and collision alert systems.  ford has not successfully created a fix for the problem.  this problem has been well documented at http://www.f150forum.com/f118/adaptive-cruise-malfunctions-scary-299485/."
"while the cruise is set and traveling on the interstate, in this case 70mph, when i pass an 18 wheeler the adaptive cruise control senses an imminent collision while passing the 18 wheeler in the left travel lane.  the adaptive cruise immediately alerts and engages the brakes.  fortunately, this has not yet resulted in a rear end collision in my case however i'm sure at some point it will with owners of these vehicles.  this has happened twice since i purchased the f150 in january(2015) and both occurrences happened while passing a tanker truck specifically and while in the left lane- tanker truck was in the right lane traveling at a slower speed perhaps around 60-65mph.  this defect to me appears to be very dangerous because if my f150 engages the brakes for no reason and there were to be cars behind me a rear end accident could likely occur on the interstate.  ford has been very slow in responding to this safety concern and has not came up with a fix for this issue.  many on internet are voicing concern however are told by dealers that the system is functioning as designed and sent on their way."

"i had the letter for the recall # 14s05 after having trouble with power steering just going out without warning and having close calls of hitting on coming traffic. the dealer acknowledged the recall letter and the vehicle was brought in and they upgraded the software and cluster panel to warn me when it would happen. it did not solve the issue with it still going out! i called a few times about it and they said that was what it was supposed to do. it would happen randomly sitting at a light and beep but no message on panel and then be ok. recently went on a trip and was getting gas and message power steering assist malfunction came on. computer hooked up at local repair shop (was weekend) stated ""torque sensor malfunction"" he hit option for auto config and helped temporarily. i notified ford that monday set appointment and car was doing it off and on all weekend and had a near miss with a head on collision as i could not even steer manually. the dealer stated it was the torque sensor and needed the steering column replaced. ford said no it was my problem to pay to fix but dealer said was related to recall. they only updated software because of the code at time but still has been a problem since, and now much worse and more often. i can not afford $1,500 for this and don't feel i should have to as was a defect with ford and 1.1 million others had this. my wife is disabled and now she can't even go to the local grocery or dr because she can not steer car when power steering goes out. the updated software just warns me by message and alarm but doesn't fix the issue and i can not drive without wondering when next near miss is an accident!! i know this recall is closed but had been given a case # by ford 07/24/15  #7564118 and spoke to maureen at 800-392-3673...updated 11/04/15 *bf    updated 12/13/2017*cn"

"while driving on the nys thruway with the cruise control activated my van came to an abrupt stop on the thruway.  there were no vehicles in close proximity to my van that would have activated the radar cruise or the autonomous emergency braking system.  after the abrupt stop all the lights on the dash were lit up ie: brake, abs, pcs, slip indicator light, and master warning light.   when i reached my destination i was unable to open the doors of my vehicle.  someone tried to open the doors from the outside of the vehicle and they were unable to open them as well.   i brought it to the local toyota dealer and they could find nothing wrong.  the above lights have lit up on several occasions however the dealer could find nothing wrong.    there has been a previous complaint for the same behavior on 6/6/15 reported to toyota for the same make and model as mine a toyota sienna premium and they have not been able to get toyota to act on it."

"in less than a week, the power steering on my 2012 ford focus has failed three times. the first time occurred on tuesday, july 28, 2015, at 7:45 a.m. i had been driving for about two minutes when the following error message appeared on my instrument cluster: ""steering assist fault/service required."" i was just about to take the ramp onto the highway, but my gut told me to pull over to the right of the road (i had a child with me and did not want to take any risks). just as i was doing so, my steering wheel locked, and i could not rotate it. as i pulled up next to the curb, i placed my car in park and turned on my hazards. i waited a few moments, but the steering wheel still would not budge. i turned my car off and on again, but the steering wheel still wouldn't move. i turned the car off again and waited about 5-10 minutes. upon starting the car this time, the steering wheel was back to normal. i left my hazards on and made right turns all the way home (in case it went out again). this incident happened again on wednesday, july 29 at 4:50 p.m. and monday, august 3 at 5:05 p.m. both times i turned off my car, waited about 5 minutes, and then started it again. the power steering would then be working.    this problem is extremely frustrating and i worry about my safety because i drive on the highway to and from work. while this has happened on the side roads, there is now a constant fear of this happening while i'm on the highway. i've read other complaints on online forums about this exact problem, so i would like to also file mine. it is also frustrating because i have had other problems with this car, such as with the moonroof, ac, and compass. i feel like ford sold me a lemon. i purchased this car from a ford dealership as certified pre-owned only a year and a half ago, so i shouldnt have this many problems with it."
"after doing my homework and research on a vehicle with #1 safety ratings in its class, i am now in a constant state of fear for the safety of not only myself and my family, but to any other innocent people around me. i travel as little as possible in a vehicle that i am still in debt a very large sum of money on. i took delivery of my 2014 jeep cherokee trailhawk, 4x4 on may 28, 2014. the first issue occurred on july 31, 2014 when the vehicle felt as though the engine dropped out into the street of my neighborhood, disabling the vehicle completely; it was not drivable, nor would it shift into neutral in order to get onto the tow truck. (the transmission and emergency braking systems failed) to make an incredibly long story short...i have experienced this same event as well as many others continuously over a 14 month period in regard to failure of my emergency braking system as well as my transmission to include: jerking so much that my purse flies from seat onto floorboard, jerking that causes my daughter to lunge forward into the back of the front passenger's seat, a stalled vehicle on busy highways and streets on numerous occasions, sudden engagement of emergency brake with the inability to release the brake while stopped at traffic lights; i could go on and on. after a total of 20+ trips to the dealerships for repairs (8-10 of these of which were via tow truck), (3) new transmissions, several repairs and modifications to the emergency braking system...my vehicle is still currently out of commission and not in my possession. i received a call on tues. of this week from the dealership to inform me that a resolution was made; yet another transmission would be installed in my death trap of a vehicle. (this makes #4) to say that this is clearly the definition of insanity is an understatement. something drastic needs to be done before people are killed."
"there was no prior warning or problem with the car at all. i just started the car for work and immediately there was no power steering. a warning message appeared ""power steering assist"" and advanctrac. i turned the car off and restarted after a minute with no change. i repeated this several more times lengthening the time interval with no change. i tried the next morning and the problem still persisted. i had the vehicle towed into the dealership and after their evaluation they stated the problem was the power steering gear and would need a total replacement at a cost of $2200.00. in 40 years of driving i have never had a power steering issue, period. there is a recall for this very problem on similar vehicles but not mine. i am writing to report that the current ford recall does not encompass all affected vehicles."
"at highway speeds (above 50 mph)  after driving for 20 minutes to 1/2 hr,  a slight turn to the left (at speed) causes the steering to stick/bind. it may be a loss of power steering assist.  this happens intermittently.      this prevents the wheel from returning to center from the left turn.  the resistance can be overcome by increasing to force applied to either return the wheel to center or to increase the left turn.  update 9/15/15*cw       *cn"
"the adaptive cruise control (acc) applies the brakes and brings the vehicle to a stop when following another vehicle in traffic.  if the vehicle ahead does not move forward within two seconds (unlikely in heavy traffic) the acc displays a message in the dash warning the driver to press the brake and then suddenly shuts off the acc and releases the brake causing the car to being to creep forward.  my car came close to rolling into the car in front because the first time i used the acc i did not expect this behavior.  the acc is promoted as having a stop and go feature.  i expected the acc to wait until the car i was behind to resume speed and then resume speed for my car accordingly.  (this is the way i was used to this feature working in my mercedes s550).  there is a sophisticated center dash computer system showing climate, radio, nav, etc.  i was exploring this system and not watching the driver information display in the dash and as such, missed the very brief message warning me to apply the brake.    besides the fact that in essence this car does not really employ a stop and go feature for all practical purposes and lulls a new driver into a false sense of security, the current implementation makes no sense from a safety standpoint.  the driver should not have to do anything for the car to resume following the car in front.  a less desirable, but better implementation would be to require some driver input to the car to resume travel - but this certainly would not qualify as a stop and go acc."
"in august 2013 after owning car short time took to dealer and service manager drove it with us and said many people think there is an issue with shuddering and delayed acceleration but it's just the high performance transmission.. not to worry.  the car continually got worse over time and we got a recall notice and took in in oct 2014.  they replaced the clutch and seals.    may 5 the car got really back on long drive home from la.  overheated and then warning light came on.  turned car off and back on warning light went off and drove car home shuddering very bad and with extreme delayed acceleration.  had cars behind us on hills honking and almost rear ended us... took car in may 15 they said it wasn't safe to drive and they had it for 2 months to fix clutch, seals and adaptive learning sensor, replaced tcm, electronics.  8/8/15 while on freeway steering assist fault notification - service required.  pulled off and when i tried to start car again i couldn't move the steering column.  called nearby ford dealer and they said you can't drive it - safety issue.  it is currently in the shop again.  having this happen on a freeway is terrifying - cars honking at you, trying to steer off, etc.  this is a danger and ford needs to take care of it instead of continuing to do temp fixes!!!!!"

"the above vehicle is a 2015 ford mustang eco-boost convertible. it is equipped with adaptive cruise control. when a vehicle in front slows below a set speed or a vehicle cuts the car off the adaptive cruise control slows the car down, or stops it, to keep a predetermined distance. according to ford the slowing is done by the engine and not the brakes. once the vehicle slows, and it is safe, it begins to accelerate back to the set cruise control speed.  the slowing, not being done by the braking system, does not activate the brake lights. only when the brake pedal is stepped on will the brake lights come on which also would disengage the cruise control. we have had a couple of incidents in which the vehicle behind does not see the car slowing, by brake lights, and closes at a rapid speed on the rear of the car. looking at a dodge ram closing, not knowing it's going to stop, can be a bit unnerving.      i have recently read that the automatic braking may be installed on future vehicles as a standard option.  i can't imagine that keeping a vehicle from crashing into a forward moving vehicle is any more or less important then being struck in the rear because brake lights  don't come on. i am certainly more cautious driving the adaptive cruise control on because of this safety issue. i have talked to ford ""customer relations dept"" who weren't  sure how to follow this up but to sent it up the ladder. i have a ford case #cas-7876013.  ...updated 12/29/15 *bf   according to ford, the slowing is done by the engine and not the brakes. once the vehicle slows down, and it is safe, it begins to accelerate back to the set cruise control speed. the slowing not being done by the braking system, does not activate the brake lights. only when the brake pedal i stepped on will the brake lights come on which also would disengage the cruise control.  the consumer stated on several occasions, other vehicles did not observe him slowing down because the brake lights did not illuminate. updated 12/31/15. *jb"

"on july 24, 2015 my wife and 2 kids, 6 and 2 years old were almost killed when the powered steering system failed, the car was impossible to control and hit the curve going over the sidewalk. my 6 year old got a bruise on his head from hitting the window and a walking pedestrian almost got killed. if my wife was going a little faster, we would be dealing with a murder by negligence case. the power steering in this model is electrical, not hydraulic; i have attached pictures of these parts. ive never seen this system before; as an electrical engineer i know this system is unreliable for any of the critical safety systems in a vehicle, such as steering or brakes. the motor could short or the brushes may wear, motor drives may burn, and even a low battery could turn these steering assistance into a load, making maneuvers even more difficult. also a computer code could create problems that can cause fatalities making sharp turns at high velocities. a hydraulic system may go low on fluid and make sounds; it may get a little harder to turn but never will get totally stuck. this system is not safe for something as critical as the steering train!"

"as i was driving, the electrical system on my 2005 dodge caravan wheelchair-accessible minivan failed completely, shutting down my power brakes, power steering, all dashboard indicators, and all vehicle lights (including the four-way flashers). fortunately, the engine continued to run, so i was able to pull it to the side of the road. this has happened to me twice. the first time we took it to our regular mechanic, who could not find anything wrong. after it happened the second time, a dodge dealer mechanic told me that the automatic braking system locking mechanism had failed and shorted out the entire electrical system and would cost $900 to repair. it also cost an extra $500 to replace the mechanism that the part is attached to because it had rusted so severely.    these incidents were frightening because it was difficult to pull the car over to the side of the road without power steering and power brakes. it would have been worse if it had happened at a higher speed or at night since all my lights would have shut off.  i would consider buying a newer wheelchair van if they were not so incredibly expensive."

this is a complaint about the tesla model s autopilot system which has just been released. despite the disclaimer by tesla motors that this should be used safely with hands on the wheel it is clear that owners are not getting the message.  there are many videos up on youtube showing owners driving for long distances totally hands free while paying little attention to the road.  here is a youtube video entitled tesla autopilot tried to kill me!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrwxex8qoxa    he is using autopilot on an undivided road    here is a video of someone driving hands free  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urnpbhldy0m&feature=youtu.be    surely it is a dangerous idea to allow this beta release software to be given out to owners of a two and a half ton high power vehicle.  incidentally the car whose vin # i have used is a burned out car    https://www.iaai.com/vehicles/vehicledetails.aspx?auctionid=0&itemid=19224036&rownumber=0&loadrecent=true    so much for the titanium battery shields!
"i have had the power steering assist fault light come on 4 times in the passed year and a half. when i went to ford they said they could not help me unless the light was on. so finally the light stays on and suddenly it is not covered by a warranty and the repair is close to $2000, how convenient is that. you know they knew that evidently the system would fail. i couldn't even turn the wheel and when i called them to explain that they told me to drive safely. this is a problem that needs to be recalled.if it was recalled for other years why not 2010?"
power steering assist fault comes on and vehicle is hard to steer. resets after shutting engine off but has came on multiple times. i have driven many vehicles with manual steering and can hardly turn the wheel on this vehicle when this fault happens
"when the car was about 3 years old, i started to feel a quick loss of power in the steering when making a turn.  it had only lasted a second and only happened at low speed in parking lots but happen while i was driving so i took it to the ford dealer in fullerton ca.  they said it was a software problem and they updated the software.  the problem disappeared but then reappeared about a year later.  i continued to drive it cause it was only occasionally at low speed for a half second in parking lots.  then in the morning of october 16, 2015, the steering of the car locked while i was in the middle of the street for about 5 seconds.  two yellow warning lights then came on in the dash and the steering released.  one warning light said ""service advance trac.""  i slowly drove it to the ford dealer in fullerton on residential streets since it was nearby.  i no longer felt safe to drive the car.  i told them the problem.  they kept the car until october 20.  the mechanic told me he had to change the entire power steering system because of an internal failure and the charge to me was $1733.  i complained but had no choice since i needed the car repaired.  i have seen very similar complaints on the internet about other mustangs.  ford recalled several other models earlier this year for the same problem; 'a potential intermittent electrical connection in the steering gear' that ford says 'might result in the loss of electric power-steering assist while driving.' these models included 2011'2012 ford fusion, 2011'2013 ford taurus, 2011'2013 ford flex, and 2011'2013 lincoln.  i believe ford knew of the problem but decided to pass the cost of repair to affected customers rather than do the recall of that model.  this risked the life of myself and others because it resulted in a loss of control while driving.  i believe i am entitled to the cost of this repair from ford. thank you.  *tr"

"an issue occurs with the power steering assist, the power steering malfunction warning light will illuminate, and the car will require more physical effort to steer.  this happens in very unsafe conditions while driving.  i then turn the car off and i am able to steer again for about 2-3 min before this happens again.  i called mazda and they are saying my vin is not part of the recall #60108 when clearly this is the same problem that the mazdas were having with 2007/08 models.  i've called mazda and they will not honor this recall."
"in july 2015 i received a recall notice from the ford company. the recall stated that the power steering system might revert to manual steering mode due to an electric power steering system fault related to the torque sensor resulting in an increase of an accident the steering effort would become greater at low speeds. on september 14th, 2015 i had my local ford dealership follow the guidelines stated for the recall and perform real 14s05 concluding that no code was present and proceeded in reprogramming the instrument cluster.  on friday, october 23rd, 2015 upon starting my car at work,  the power steering wheel did not work and manual steering was required upon driving to the local ford dealership.  no light was on the dash board or the info setting to indicate that there was an issue.  upon starting my car at the dealership, the power steering started working again. on monday, october 26th, the same dealership performed the recall 14s05 again checking for dtc's and the torque light sensor fault code b2278 was present.  no pinpoint tests available for the code and the chart called for sensor replacement. the cost to fix this is $700 and would have been paid for by the recall a month prior if it had shown up on the performed recall test.  the ford dealership said that they had not seen any recall vehicles with the steering column intermittently working but had replaced the steering wheel column all together.  ford company: ""any subsequent loss of assist repairs experienced after completion of module reprogramming are not covered by this recall"".  the software updates may extend the time steering assist is maintained.  the update provides increased driver awareness by sounding a chime and displaying the wrench light or warning in the message center when a fault is detected.""  this clearly did not happen when my car lost it's power steering on october 23rd, 2015."
"i was driving in houston, going north on kirby drive, which is a busy city street, at approximately 4:30 pm on monday, oct. 26, 2015.  shortly before i reached the intersection of kirby dr. and sunset blvd, i approached a standard sized steel sheet/plate in the road.  the brake alert flashed on my dashboard.  i ignored the alert and continued to drive, because my car was not in danger of hitting anything.  as i got closer to the steel plate, the vehicle's collision mitigation braking system applied the brakes on its own, i assume because it perceived the steel plate to be a collision threat.  i had no control over my suv, and there was nothing i could do to resume normal acceleration. the collision mitigation braking system only disengaged once the suv was directly on top of the steel plate.  my children and i narrowly avoided a rear-end collision.      at the time, because the city street was so busy, i was only traveling 20-25 mph, as were the other cars around me.  i fear what would have happened at higher speeds.  many houston roads, including our busy highways, have steel plates covering road repair projects.  i am afraid the brakes will engage spontaneously on the highway.      when i called my dealership shortly after the incident occurred, i was informed that unless there is an active signal on my car showing the need for some kind of service, the dealership won't be able to fix or identify the problem.  supposedly, my vehicle was subject to the may 20, 2015 forward collision avoidance recall involving the 2015 acura mdx collision mitigation braking system (nhtsa campaign #15v301000).  the dealership said that it addressed the recall issue as a part of my august 2015 checkup, and that as a result, my vehicle met all standards.  i note that my complaint is not the only one pertaining to this issue (see nhtsa id #10763775).  the recall fix may not have worked."

"the power steering system on different occasions has stopped working completely, other times it just takes more of an effort to turn the wheel each occurance can last from a few seconds or much longer periods of time and doesn't matter if its low or high speeds. also when starting the vehicle a low battery light is somtimes iluminated. the loss of power steering assistance is complete unpredictable."

"power steering assist fault (or failure) while driving.  steering locks up, difficult to steer.  have to stop vehicle, turn off engine and re-start.  steering works again.   difficult to control car with steering.  dangerous.   saw recall on this, but ford says doesn't apply to my vin?"
my car pulls to the left despite having it aligned 3 times at 2 different shops.  the power steering has failed completely 3 times within the last 3000 miles.  failure was noted as power steering whine followed by a blown hose or seal and loss of all fluid and power steering assistance.     there is a recall #14116 for my make model and year which matches the symptoms of my problems  but when contacting the manufacturer i was informed my vin was not part of the recall.
"lost power steering.  vehicle was stationary.  dealer is claiming that b/c i brought it in to them 10 months ago and had the codes checked (none found at the time), that my recall coverage is now null and void.   i would have been better off never taking it in for the recall, as the charges are around $1000.00 and are exactly what my car is recalled for (electric power steering assist failure.)"
"hazardous feature -- do not use -- notify tesla immediately --     incident 1)  i tested the recently downloaded ""autopilot"" feature on a freeway with solid lines at both edges and a dashed line between the two lanes.  speed was 70mph, wind light, visibility good in daylight, traveling in the right lane.  when the vehicle encountered an off-ramp (on the right) where the right edge white line followed the ramp's right edge, all hell broke loose.  the car tried to follow the line for the ramp.  i braked and steered left, winding up in the triangular no-mans-land defined by the right lane of the freeway, the ramp, and the various barriers and landscaping at the top of the triangle.  i accelerated out of the triangle, wondering why this feature was released by tesla.    incident 2)  a few miles later, not having learned anything i guess, i reactivated ""autopilot.""  another few miles later a small bird flew in front of the car.  hell broke loose again as the car braked and swerved out of the slow lane into the fast lane.  fortunately there was no traffic nearby.  i recovered my track and deactivated the ""autopilot.""  this feature is just kids' stuff, not ready for the real world.    recommendations:    1)  instruct tesla to delete this feature from their cars immediately; lives could be saved if they do so.    2)  other manufacturer's cars with an ""autopilot"" kind of feature must be tested for hazardous behaviors.      good luck.  this stuff is dangerous.  i will also be notifying tesla of these incidents.

power steering assist fault safety issue
"this involves the expensive safety accessory: ""forward collision avoidance ""on this  vehicle, this safety feature is intermittent. as i'm driving on a city street or freeway, the unit suddenly turns off and at the same time, the cruise control turns off. in order to re-engage the systems, the engine must be turned off and re-started. the problems started about 2 months ago. ( oct.-2015)  i count on this safety feature. (forward collision avoidance) as an example, the car in front has no brake lights, i have no idea that it is slowing and comes to an abrupt stop. this could result in a collision, whereas the avoidance feature gives plenty of warning in regards to the sudden slowing of the vehicle in front.     i wonder how many of these units may have original factory defects, yet have not been reported?   thank you.  *tr"
"power steering assist is lost while i was  trying to parallel  parking  early this year.    laterly i changed a new electric power streering motor ,but when i try to do parallel parking,the power steering assist is lost again."
"while driving 35-40 mph in the city, the service advancetrac and service power steering now lights came on as well as tcs off and tcs on indicators and it was becoming harder to drive. once i reached my destination and i restarted the car i had no power steering assist. this is the second occasion. first time my boyfriend was driving 11/20/15 and described the same occurances. it was taken to a ford dealer ft wayne indiana and was told it was the steering gear. this was replaced and ive learned that its been part of a recall. so $1700 later it was fine. picked up my vehicle dec 1 then the second occurance was just 10 days later on dec 11. taken to the dealer once again. the dealer cleared the codes and recalibrated and power steering was back but now im told the control arms caused it this time."
"electronic power steering assist fails intermittently typically upon starting of the vehicle.  sometimes the problem goes away after several minutes of hard steering, other times turning off the ignition and then back on resets the issue.  once it apparently happened to my son while operating the vehicle at highway speeds.  very dangerous situation and ford needs to address it as a covered safety recall issue."
"i was driving my vehicle on 12/08/2015 when all of a sudden a light stating "" power steering assist fault service advancetrac i called the ford dealer and they stated that i would have to take the vehicle to get inspected. the car is not drivable. i almost got into a huge wreck when this happened."

"absolutely abysmal customer service experience with orange buick gmc orlando. i had them do two recalls on my '05 saturn: the ignition switch (which was giving me problems due to the passlock system), and the electric steering assist (which i'd had _zero_ problems with prior, it was done as a precaution).    after the steering motor was replaced, i started having intermittent power steering codes on startup with no assist (turning the car off then on clears it). they replaced the motor again. problem still occurs. now they're saying the steering column is suspect, it's not covered under the recall, and they won't do anything about it. how funny that the column would have been touched by their techs for both the motor and ignition replacements."
"while driving down and interstate ""power steering assist failure"" warning comes up and i lost all power steering. i was able to muscle the car home and after calling the dealer the service manager said they had no idea why that would happen. after researching on the site, it seems this is a common problem that is recalled in some model years but not in others.  i have been complaining about the ""service advancetrak"" warning coming on since i purchased the vehicle and was always told it wasn't hurting anything. i have an extended warranty but after reading it may not do any good.   i will be at the dealership tomorrow."

intermittent electric power steering assist failures.  failures seem to occur most often when the car is cold and backing out of drive way or parking spaces.   power steering will work for a very short period then fail leaving typically when in the middle of a backing maneuver when leaving my drive and entering traffic.  turning car off and restarting will reset the electric power steering assist.  this is particularly dangerous in crowded parking areas when i need to turn the car off and restart while blocking traffic.  the frequency seems to be increasing for the failures but dealer does not seem to be able to reproduce.
"when the adaptive cruise control  (acc) and the vehicle lane keeping assist system (lkas) are engaged simultaneously, the vehicle will react unpredictably under certain conditions. the vehicle may brake suddenly, rapidly decelerate, and quickly depart the highway when approaching exit ramps. the situation occurs during daylight and nighttime hours with clean cameras and radar window. driver response time is too slow to counteract the event. the vehicle may slow by 10-15 mph and depart the highway before the driver is able to resume control. during 300 miles of highway driving, the vehicle did this twice. a rear end collision was narrowly avoided in one case."
"i was driving with my kids and out of nowhere, i received a ""power steering assist fault"" message display across the deck and i couldn't steer. it took immense effort to turn; and fortunately for us, it occurred really close to our house but on a major city street on the way home. i read online that there are tons of incidents with their ford vehicle. i read an article online that ford recalled over 450k vehicles for this issue but when i looked up my vin on safercar.gov and the ford website; there isn't a recall issued for it.  there seem to be drivers out there who were both more or less fortunate than i was. i wanted to file a formal complaint to see if i can get this issue investigated."
"i started the car and had to warning lights come on. one warning for steering assist fault, and the other for service advancetrac. i read online that ford is recalling cars same year and model for the same issues.  but no recall for mine - why??"
"i parked my 2013 ford fusion with 52,000 miles on it for 3 days in my driveway and when i started it a message saying power steering assist fault came on and there isn't any power steering. i contacted ford and they said they will look at it but i had to pay for the tech's time, i then looked on the web and it said there was a recall on this for over 445k ford cars, but my vin was not part of it because of where the car was made. so i am confused, 1 part of the car is recalled if it was put in one plant, but the same part put in another plant isn't. they were all made in one plant, so why does it matter where it was installed. the part is defected, if i was driving down the road and this happened, and had an accident, would it be my fault because the car was made in a safe factory where the part is not being recalled?  same part, same problem, why isn't this being recalled with the others."
"while turning a corner the power steering went out and became extremely heavy, almost unable to turn the wheel to complete the turn.  a notification came on from the car indicating ""service advance trac"" and ""steering assist fault service required"".   *js"
i was moving my vehicle from outside drive into my garage. when steering assist message appeared. at this point power steering failed. was able to drive vehicle inside. i had vehicle towed to ford dealer were the steering power pack module was replaced.
"while driving battery red light on dashboard light up make it home just 1 mile away. next day when start the car to see if anything change or find anything wrong that i can see. the car start no battery light, no longer on, after like a minute i start backing out of my driveway and i heard a noise (like a buzzing) noise i drive back in my driveway, while engine running i open the hood to look from where the noise was coming and i see  lot of smoke was coming from alternator i went shot off engine and it got the throttle body red light on the dash board on and the smoke intensified i shot off the engine and disconnect the battery  to prevent the car to got on fire .the smoke still coming out of the alternator for approximately 15 to 20 minutes after i shot off and disconnect the battery.now i don't even want to connect the battery back.  this is avery unsafe situation if i would be driving on a highway and the alternator fail it would disable the engine making it hard to steer the car and apply the brakes the power steering pump in this car is electric no electric power no steering assist , no engine running no break assist and the chance the battery fail because of short or burn alternator can cause the battery to overheat the battery is inside the car under passenger seat. i was lucky that i notice the situation right away and take action to prevent an accident or a fire ."

"i was making a long distance road trip and began to notice subtle vibrations in the steering wheel. the vibrations began to increase in intensity over time, most noticeably when the car was at idle. at one point the vibrations were very intense during idle. after a rest stop i turned the car on and tried to turn the steering wheel but had much difficulty. the electronic power steering assist was not functioning. i had previously brought my escape to a ford dealership for recall #14s05 where they updated the pscm to address the issue i was experiencing now. the torque sensor has failed causing the epas to shut off even after my car was supposedly fixed a year prior. ford has failed to address the issue fully and the work done to correct recall #14s05 is insufficient."

"car has 11,000 miles, automatic transmission.      while driving straight on a highway using the cruise control set at 65 mph with the adaptive cruise control on (feet not touching the gas pedal or brake) the car engine rpm's began increasing till it reached the rev limiter.  at the same time the engine rpm began revving high, the car began to coast as if it was in neutral.  but the gear shift remained in drive.  after a few seconds of the engine revving as high as it could, the engine shut off and i was able to get the car stopped.  i had to put my hazards on and steer off to the shoulder to avoid getting hit from behind.  this has happened to me twice.  first time 10/8/15 the car would not start after i coasted to a stop and had to have it towed to the subaru dealer.  they hooked the car up to their computer for a diagnostic test and found no error codes.  second time this happened to me on 1/2/16 after stopping on the shoulder i was able to restart the car and drive home without using cruise control.  the car is going back to the dealer for another test this friday 1/8/16.  this whole process probably takes about 30 second or so.  but its very dangerous.    its almost as if the transmission is some how not engaged.  since the cruise is set at 65 mph it tries to increases engine rpm to maintain 65 mph speed but the transmission is not engaged so car does not accelerate.  cruise sees car slowing down so speeds up the engine to compensate.  cars still doesn't speed up.  eventually engine rpm maxes out for a few seconds and turns itself off.  i feel like the problem lies with the transmission most likely or possibly the cruise control.    i also notice when pulling out of a parking space going from reverse to drive it takes about 5 seconds for the transmission to engage.  to the point that i roll back a few feet."

"while attempting to turn left (across oncoming traffic lanes) the steering wheel seized after rotating only a few degrees.  this was sudden and abrupt with no prior symptoms.  substantial force was applied in an attempt to continue the turn.  the steering wheel became free and rotated a few more degrees before seizing again.  as before, substantial pressure was applied and i believe some back rotation (wiggling) was input.  the steering finally became free and felt normal.  this did not repeat again during the use of the vehicle that day.  the seizure did not feel like a failure of the steering assist (pump) system as the steering wheel could not be rotated as it can be if the steering pump isn't running.  some research found reference to binding of the u-joints on the intermediate steering shaft located in the engine compartment.  examination of these joints found that they are not protected by rubber boots and showed evidence of corrosion.  a spray lubricant was used in an attempt to prevent the issue from recurring.  the inability to steer the vehicle is, in my opinion, a substantial safety issue.  any number of scenarios could be imagined, but in my particular case, had the seizure not released, i would have found myself stopped in the path of oncoming traffic with the vehicle only partially turned."
"my 2012 ford taurus sho was brought into jones west ford in reno, nevada. it was at jones west for a power steering recall. while on the interstate back home the adaptive cruise control, faulted and caused a warning to appear, as well as a collision avoidance fault. at the dealership in fallon, the service advisor informed me that the acc module was faulty and needed to be replaced. fallon completed the work but on a quality assurance ride to ensure the module was working correctly, the technicians found that the vehicle was making steering inputs without the driver turning the steering wheel. the technicians returned to the dealer to diagnose what had caused the steering inputs. they traced the problem back to the abs control module and pump, and ordered a brand new one. they ordered the abs module around the 23rd of november 2015, but due to stocking problems the part did not arrive until around the 24th of december. i was not offered a rental vehicle by the dealership, an apology from ford for the inconvenience. after the dealership finally received the part and installed it, the technicians ran into a problem with the pcm accepting the new module, a new problem arose; the instrument panel cluster would operate normally for a time and then the lights would dim, and then completely turn off. when the vehicle was hooked up to the obdii system, it even shut the diagnostic equipment down as well. the technicians at fallon auto mall realized they did not know how to fix the problem and called a field office technician in denver for advice. he advised the technicians and service manager to check a few different components on the vehicle but, as of today the vehicle is still not drivable and the technicians still do not understand what is happening with the vehicle and even mentioned that the acc module is still not working properly."
electronic power steering assist system keeps failing. recall was replace in early 2015 and again was in the dealer on 12/30/15 for the same problem with power steering failing. on 1/08/15 the power steering system yet again failed and this time this power steering failure caused the car to go into the ditch and through a barb wire feance. this has been a ongoing problem with my car and general motors does not seem to have some kind of fix or does not want to admit there car has this problem. i have the documents from the dealer where it was soposed to be fixed on 12/30/15.

"all the safety complaints in the past two forms happen in all the 2014,2015. and 2016 mercedes s550. the cars are suppose to practically drive themselves. it even has steering assist that keeps the car centered in the lane and will even steer around curves.  it is suppose to keep pre set distances from the car in front that you can set between 100 and 200 feet. it is suppose to stop before hitting an object in front of the car. none work. what is going to happen when in 2020 when the car mercedes build will actually drive itself. if they cannot get this simple safety features to work correctly in my car, how is it going to work when it  mass produces cars that totally drive themselves.. the driver assistance pkg. works like it was never installed in my car, how will having the car take over more control work. if i do not feel safe in my car now god help us all. when all the cars drive themselvews. sure the ones they are driving as test cars work. they were hand built. what happens when they are mass produced whith other countries making the parts. it sounds as if mercedes is going to have a massive recall campaign with the safety features that do not work now."
"adaptive cruise control  the acc on my truck malfunctions unexpectedly and frequently when passing large trucks at highway speed.  when it malfunctions, it causes collision warning systems to activate including unexpected and hard braking.  i have taken the truck to the dealership where i purchased it twice for this problem.  once before and once after the recall.  there was not change the first time and after the second time the problem was reduced in severity and frequency but continues to happen.  my service department is willing to look at it again, but says there is nothing to do that they have not already done.  the unexpected braking not only is a surprise to the driver, but it also may cause vehicles following to react inappropriately.  this danger is exaggerated because it frequently happens on the interstate while passing large trucks."
"on december 31, 2015, i experienced a power steering assist failure. this warning appeared in the dash display. i had no power steering in the car. i was trying to pull out of a parking space. the problem continued when driving. turning off and restarting the car had no effect in clearing the failure. also had an advance trac warning appear on the dash and the turn signals would only operate if held manually in position.    i know there was a recall (ford recall number 15s18) issued which covers this problem in ford flex vehicles built before mine. my flex was built 9/25/2012.     the dealer corrected the problem by replacing pscm.  however, since the mileage put the car just out of warranty, i had to pay for the repairs.    it appears that the steering problem continued on cars built after feb. 2012 which was the build date specified in the above recall.    i would like the build date for covered repairs to be extended and communicated to ford motor company.     i am unable to upload the documentation at this time."
"i purchased my 2011 dodge duango citadel in august 2015.  on several occasions, both weeks and months apart, my hazard lights will randomly cut off and on just long enough for you to think you're crazy and second guess if  you saw them. i eventually had to take my car to the dodge dealership because the car was not turning over at the start and became inoperable.  once at the dealership, the manager determined that although my car reported to have already had the tipm replaced, it was actually not.  the original tipm was still in the car, meaning that the carfax reporting that the tipm recall had been executed was false.  after my tipm was replaced, my car operated fine until one day whilei was driving with my 2 year old in the car.  i was coming up on a stop sign, and when i went to make a right hand turn my car stalled.  all of the lights were on and the radio still functioned, but i lost complete power steering and my hazard lights would not work when i tried to cut them on to alert other drivers.  i was able to put my car in park and restart it successfully.  i took around 3 weeks before i was able to make an appt. for my car to be looked at.  during this time my hazard lights sporadically came on from time to time, lasting no longer than a couple of seconds.  might i mention that when the car stalled my fcw off light and the adaptive cruise control symbol came on.  after a thorough review at the dodge dealership, i was informed that that there was no problem detected.  i was told that all the connections were checked and that no trouble codes were coming up when running diagnostics.  i left the dealersihp hoping my problem had been a fluke.  boy was i wrong!  since then, my hazard lights have still been spiratically going off and has stalled again, this time while i was making a left hand turn onto my road with my 5 year old in the car. this is ridiculous!"

"safety recall 14s05/nhtsa recall 14v-284 was performed on this vehicle in august 2014. the service performed was a software modification that was described as being able to prevent the vehicle from going into manual steering mode without warning and as a result of a torque senor defect.  in january 2016 the power steering assist stopped functioning while driving and moved into manual steering mode. this was in a low traffic urban area at low speed.  we were able to get the vehicle off road without incident.  the vehicle remains in manual steering mode and there is a ""power steering assist fault"" warning display on the dash.  the ford recall letter indicates the dealer repair would remove this possibility where the vehicle could revert to manual steering mode due to a detected fault.  the letter also indicates a chime and wrench light would ensue if a defect/fault were detected to ""increase driver awareness"".  it is not our experience that we had this warning provided.  there is no wrench light illuminated and the vehicle was not prevented from moving into manual steering mode. in short, i do not believe that the service procedure in this recall where only software code was modified was sufficient to remove the potential hazards of any defects that may by inherent in the power steering assist system of this vehicle.  i contacted the dealership where the software revision was conducted and was told that without a ""check engine light"" indication, they would probably not be able to read and determine the fault.  i indicated the nature of my understanding of the recall on this vehicle to see if a further needed repair of the torque sensor would be allowed under the recall due to these circumstances. i was told the recall was closed.  i do not believe the initial repair was sufficient."

the power steering return hose was in contact with the front suspension sway bar at curb condition with the vehicle stationary. the sway bar moves a couple inches with suspension travel and this will rub on the power steering hose considerably and can where a hole causing loss of power steering assist and a flammable fluid spraying in the engine and exhaust area. i know for a fact that fca has been shipping vehicles like this in direct violation of their safe design guidelines or at least 1.5 years now from july of 2014 until now.  i worked at fca in 2014 and told them to contain this issue on multiple occasions and i was ignored by my fca management and plant quality people.
while at milosch palace chrysler jeep dealership in lake orion i noticed the power steering return hose was contacting the front suspension sway bar at stationary curb condition. this is a design violation which i told fca about when i worked there in 2014.  the issue has existed now from july of 2014 until now. the hose can wear a hole in it due to a 2 inch rubbing interference with suspension movement and the vehicle will lose steering assist and  power steering fluid can spray in the exhaust system causing a fire.
while looking at vehicles on the dealer lot i noticed this vehicle had the power steering pressure hose in contact to the dash panel steel upper cross member. since the pressure hose moves with the engine it can wear a hole in the hose and the vehicle will lose steering assist and spray fluid on the catalytic converter which was close by. this was an issue i discovered in august of 2014 while working at fca and i told the company this issue was a design safety violation of fca out standards. i was ignored. some vehicles which had not been shipped yet were knowingly shipped with this unacceptable hose clearance condition.

"when starting the car, i will get a power steering assist fault warning. the power steering will not work. i turn the car off and on to try to clear the error and reset the power steering. this normally works. sometimes it takes multiple tries to clear and function normally. i am worried that this error will occur while i am driving and cause an accident. i am also concerned that my vehicle is not included in the recall of ford vehicles with the same issue. this issue has occurred 6 times in the past week."

i received a recall notice from ford telling me to bring the truck to the dealer to have the adaptive cruise control reprogrammed.  i did have this work done.  after the work was done i had an incident where i was passing an 18 wheeler and the truck set off the collision warning alarm and applied the brakes hard.  if someone was following closely it would have been a collision.  there was no traffic in my lane for at least 1/4 mile ahead.  ford has not been helpful in resolving this issue and their only suggestion is to turn off the adaptive cruise control.  i paid a lot of money for what i feel is an important and useful safety feature and want ford to fix the system so it will not malfunction and possibly cause a rear end collision.

"please note that my vehicle has already been serviced at the dealership for nhtsa campaign 15v100000 (hyundai recall 127).   while driving between 34-45 mph, i heard a subtle click from either my steering column or behind the dash, which was immediately followed by illumination of the eps warning light and complete loss of power steering assistance.  the vehicle became very difficult to steer, and remained in this condition until i reached my destination , which was about another 30 minutes worth of driving time.  i imagine that some younger/weaker drivers might not be able to physically steer the car while in this condition, but i was able to manage.  the car was left in a parking lot for about 8 hours, at which point upon starting the engine, the eps warning light turned off and power steering was again fully functional.  the dealership said my car had already been serviced for the power steering recall 127, and it would cost $120 to investigate.   i did not bring the vehicle in for this diagnostic.  the problem appears to be an intermittent problem, and has not yet recurred."

"while using the autopilot on a busy i-80 freeway in san francisco. i was driving south and in the middle lane trying to  make a lane change into the left lane.  i hit the speed adjuster knob instead of the turn signal, this automatically increases the speed of the car without intending to perform such action. this action could prove fatal if a bicyclist or other bikes in the category are in front. this is a design flaw. the turn signal is too close to the speed adjuster knob, and i could foresee a safety incidence occurring due to this lapse.  thank you.  *tr"

"my 2016 f150 has adaptive cruise control (""acc"") that applies brakes in the event a vehicle is detected in lane ahead in order to match speed and maintain safe distance. f150 also has collision avoidance system that increases sensitivity of brakes if imminent collision is detected.    2015 ford f150 has been subject to a recall (nhtsa campaign number: 15v614000) to fix problems with acc - the acc may falsely detect an obstacle in its path and may unexpectedly apply the brakes increasing the risk of a rear-end collision from a following vehicle.    my 2016 f150 was built after the date covered by the recall however it exhibits the exact problem described in the recall i.e. the problem continues to exist with ford's acc system and the recall was insufficient.    in my case, on four separate occasions from 3/19 through 3/26/2016 the acc system activated unexpectedly and for no reason, causing heavy braking and in one case almost causing collision with a following vehicle. the collision warning lights also lit up - this system may itself have increased severity of braking. braking events occurred with two different drivers, on straight freeway, no steering input, no bridges, or safety barriers to confuse the acc radar. in all cases we were driving in left lane of a two lane freeway, approaching to pass a large vehicle travelling in right lane - a semi-truck in two cases, empty car transporter in other two. the vehicle being passed was well in its lane and not drifting over or presenting any danger to our vehicle.    ford's response has been that this is ""normal"" and was due to our driving on a curve, or other vehicle drifting over or some road ""furniture"" like a bridge / barrier confusing the system.  however, none of these factors applied."

"my 2011 ford explorer started having power steering assist failure in dec, 2015  at first it would be on first start up, lasting 3-4 seconds with a frozen steering wheel. gradually it happened more often and lasted longer (5-10 seconds)  recently in march 2016 while driving across florida on vacation, i slowed to enter  the driveway of a shopping center, as i made the turn at approximately 15 mph  my steering went stiff and i had to use excessive force to turn and avoid a vehicle exiting the parking lot. it was only then i google searched if other explorer owners  had experienced similar failures. that's when i learned that its happening to thousands of other ford explorer. even though a safety recall has been issued to  replace the steering gear, you'll find ford will want to change other parts first, parts not covered on the recall. the steering gear is very expensive ($1,500)  first the dealer said its the steering wheel angle sensor and not the steering gear. they told me it would fix the problem and they charged me for the repair......i literally pulled out of suburban ford of waterford michigan and drove 1 mile to a nearby grocery store, after returning to my vehicle on the first start up  after this repair my steering was frozen for 7-10 seconds  after 4 days loss of usage of my vehicle while at the dealership, no rental car offered, i'll be returning my explorer to the dealer tomorrow, i'll keep posting  updates to this nightmare with ford motor co.   folks, i'm sure you'll all agree, loss of steering is one of the most dangerous  defects a vehicle can have, not only to the owner and occupants but to the   other innocent drives on the road as well"
"after having epas replaced (@hall ford ellizabeth city, nc) under recall 15n01 after complete power steering failure. we began a 700 mi. road trip home and began to experience spontaneous traction control interaction with our driving input which affected either power distribution to the axels, braking ability, and steering ability. after making it nearly 300 miles the electronic stability control completely went out along with what felt like abs control seemed like it intervened sporadically. we also recieved a dash prompt that the fuel filler inlet needed checked as well. upon arrival to a ford dealer along our route (sheehy ford, warrenton, va) they pulled the codes listed and appeared to be a litany of  codes nearly a page and a half long. they cleared the codes and drove the vehicle. after driving the vehicle around the block the traction control began to act intermittently without loss of traction. they came back and checked for error codes and the ""steering position sensor was at fault"" they went through re-calibrated the equipment installed and cleared out the codes and drove without any issues. we then continued on our remainder of our trip without any further issues. upon arrival to our home destination the following day we began to again have traction control intervening with driver input when not needed where it appears to be shifting power from axle to axle or applying braking to aid in traction control. i have also noticed that that rear view camera displays the postion of the driver wheel in relation to the wheel path in reverse but appears intermittant as if there is a not a continuous connection with the sensor. taking to our local ford dealer here monday 4-4-16 to have them thoroughly go through the vehicle but appears to continue to be an issue with the electronic power steering assist. all issues are present when traveling at speed and turning"

adaptive cruise control braking issue.  my new 2016 ford f150 platinum edition pick up truck will automatically brake hard when passing some large trucks while operating in adaptive cruise control.  the lane ahead of me was clear with no vehicles in sight in my lane each time this happened.  the large trucks i passed were on my right and not in my lane or even close to the lane markers.  the large trucks did not have anything hanging over into my lane.  these dangerous braking events happened while i was driving on very good dry highways and freeways in arizona.  i have no stickers or after market items on my new f150 truck.  this hard automatic braking happened to me on four different occasions during the month of march.  in each of the four braking events i was traveling between 65 and 75 mph on straight high quality roads in arizona. i was almost rear-ended the last time it happened so i'm no longer using cruise control.  as of today 4/8 my truck is at the morgan hill ford store in morgan hill calif for inspection of this dangerous problem.

"this vehicle has several complaints for the power steering assist failure.  i have video of when mone failed and took a lot of other things with it like the air bags, brakes, advance track system and more. i called ford only to be told that they have never heard of such failure occuring! this is bull and they need to recall those vehicles for replacement before someone is killed. just wondering if that is what everyone is waiting for before anyone forces them to recall these vehicles.  i have video proving all that it takes out when it fails. what do i do from here file a law suit of my own? had i been in an accident when the power steeringwent out i most likely would have been killed as the air bags would not have functioned. i would like to see my car replaced or at the very least repaired. when this happened to me i was driving down a highway at 70 mph and the power steering failed then the brakes then the air bags. most everything was taken out by the failure of the power steering. my husband was with me and can attest to what happened as he was the driver.

"this is our second new hyundai elantra, model year 2015. after about 16,000 miles, we noticed a ""glitch"" that seemed to be occurring at higher, but modest speeds (40-65 mph). the smooth steering-wheel range of motion that we are normally used to seemed to change at road speeds, exhibiting a point where minor l-r steering-wheel adjustments were stiff, almost like a ""detent"" in a normal smooth range of  motion. researching this behavior, i also found comments on the net that were described as ""sticky"" steering with 2012 model elantras...seemed like a good descriptive term.  the problem was not solved by an wheel alignment last week, but a re-visit to the dealer today and discussion with their service manager, suggested that there may be a steering assist-pump servo issue which has been known to be associated with the symptoms. there was a discussion with the svc manger of a replacement of the steering column assembly. i would like to believe that that action will solve the matter."

"april 26, 2016 - my wife was at a gas station and said the wheels on the gmc were very hard to turn either way.  shortly thereafter, she started to hear a whining noise when she would turn left or right. a day later, the noise was more pronounced so i went out for a test drive.  the steering seemed ok and the whining noise didn't seem that bad too me.  april 28, 2016 - my wife said the noise was louder so i test drove it again, this time, i experienced a momentary loss of steering power on low speed. one time i overcompensated when it was hard to turn the wheel but avoided having an accident. i performed the owner's manual checks, power steering fluid level was good. i then goggled for more information online about steering issues and how to resolve on gmc 2009 acadia and then i ran into the gmc service bulletin sb-10056459-3388 online. the bulletin described the intermittent power loss we experienced. the condition is described as follows ""vehicles may develop a power steering pump wear condition that can cause an intermittent drop of power steering hydraulic pressure that will cause reduced or loss of steering assist.  the vehicle may revert to manual steering which requires greater driver effort, particularly at low vehicle speeds"". i called our local gm's service department for an evaluation but have not received a callback yet. i am concerned because i believe, if not resolved,  may turn out to be a safety issue for us."

"i was driving on the interstate, and had noticed my steering wheel was kind of tight, and making little adjustments didn't feel normal. i was traveling at 70 mph, and the car couldn't make a small curve, i had to swerve into the next lane, almost hit the concrete wall. my warning light came on steering assist fault service immediately . i pulled off the interstate as i did there was a horrible gridding sound at any little turn of the wheel. the steering became completely useless, the car was drifting into oncoming traffic and wouldn't turn at all. i parked the car and turned it off, when i turned it backed on the error has changed to complete system failure, and the steering wheel will not move at all."
"i was driving my truck when the ""service advancetrac"" light came on. the steering became sluggish. the next day, my wife was driving the truck with the children inside, when the power steering assist completely went out, became nearly impossible to steer and made very loud, almost screeching noises when trying to turn the wheel. this resulted in my family nearly crashing in the truck. this was while driving on the paved highway/roadway."
"sudden loss of steering assist. messages appeared to ""service advancetrack"" and ""service steering"". two incidences within 3 days.  both times the vehicle was in motion, once on an exit ramp and once on a state highway. near loss of control due to the extremely difficult manual steering mode that resulted.  very unnerving and dangerous to suddenly lose steering while on the highway. fortunately i was strong enough to maintain vehicle control. my wife may not have been so fortunate."
"there are three problems i want to complain:  1) information screen flickers for 10 minutes after starting the engine. i sent it to dealer shop, but they said that they never heard of such a problem, and had no solution. the problem happened at least three times per week in the past two months.  2) information screen shows six different warning messages after starting the engine, including abs failure, vsa failure, low battery level, collision mitigation failure, adaptive cruise control failure etc. i took it to the dealer, the reason they told me is that they had one of my tires replaced one week before and tpms had not been reset correctly. however, why it took two weeks for the system to give the warning messages instead of right after tire got changed?  3) tpms failed to detect flat tire. i was driving a car with one flat tire for 1 mile, and the tpms even failed to detect the flat tire."
"possible malfunction with the automatic braking system (abs). car fails to brake properly and slides when pressure is applied the brake. my wife was driving about 45mph and when she tried to stop, slid into the back of an 18-wheeler."
"power steering assist indicator comes up intermittently when starting the car or while driving and it is extremely difficult or impossible to steer the car. now it has not gone off for days and i am unable to safely operate my vehicle. it has happened to my mother a couple of times on the highway and she almost got into an accident at 70mph. ford needs to address and correct this before there are anymore accidents or deaths. they did it in their other vehicles, why did they leave out the focus??? and for that matter, when is the nhtsa going to finally step in????"
"tl* the contact owns a 2010 ford fusion. the contact stated that the steering wheel failed and the power steering assist failed to engage, which made the steering wheel difficult to turn. the dealer was unable to perform a diagnostic because the failure was intermittent. the steering wheel normally returned to normal on its own after a few minutes. there was no warning indicator illuminated when the failure occurred. the vin was not available. the manufacturer was not notified. the failure mileage was 110,000.

"my 2016 f-150 plarinum with adaptive cruise control, runs up behind vehicles on occasions then brakes hard. if the other vehicle is a semi, as you attempt to pass him with adaptive cruise on, the car brakes hard and slows down on occasions. in addition to this problem, on 5 different occasions when coming to a bend in the road, the steering gets very stiff as if the power steering is inoperative. the is very briefly before the steering returns to a very sensitive steering , also very brief. the vehicle at this point is in a under steer condition which it corrects itself. this has occurred at least 6 times. my selling ford dealer has twice checked the programing with 0 results. no codes- no problems when they test drive it. the vehicle has 3550 miles and i'm getting scared to drive it. this first problem is identical to the 2015 ford f-150 problem. according to my selling dealer, my vehicle which i purchased 2/19/16 was built towards the end of last year, but my dealer states this has no bearing on my alleged cruise problems. my selling dealer is two rivers ford in mount juliet, tennessee. an additional vehicle at their dealership has been reported by one of their salesmen to have the same problem to management, and the problem exists today is my understanding. the speed at which these problems arise is varied and on at least one occasion i was almost rear ended by a semi who was coming up behind me when the brakes applied themselves."
"i have a 2013 ford explorer with 44,000 miles and sent it to the dealer. the dealer said the power steering gear box is not functioning and needs to be replaced. there is a recall on ford explorer's for the 2011-2013 models for the ""power steering assist fault"", which did come on and the power steering failed in my vehicle. i contact ford directly and they were of no help and offered no assistance."
"on 6/82016 i was driving to work in the early morning , as i accelerated forward while turning the corner at a elementary school zone, a steering assist fault error message appeared on my instrument cluster. then i lost all steering and i could not turn the wheel to avoid the small children and parents that were at the corner waiting for me to pass.i slammed on the brakes and avoided a life changing tragedy. i towed the car to santa margarita ford who informed me that the electronic power steering box failed and the repair was going to be $1,895. i called ford and talked to alex (case # tas-9779156-d5j4q5) who took my report , checked and quickly returned with bad news that there was nothing they can do. i asked him if someone needed to die for ford to take resposiblity for this unsafe system, but got no reply."

"car reports steering assist fault, service required sometimes at startup, sometimes while in motion, resulting in loss of power steering. restarting the car results in normal operation for a time, sometimes a day sometimes weeks. no obd2 code present."
"while driving the car and accelerating to highway speed, with autopilot/tacc enabled it will brake hard from highway speeds to and incorrect ""known"" 45 mph (+5 mph auto pilot threshold). i use ""known"" as it appears to be gps data that presents the mph. the actual speed limit is 65 mph. drivers will notice the cars dash board will display the incorrect mph as well.   result is that when getting on to highway, it slows you back down to 45-50 mph. if accelerating on an on ramp, with cruise control active it will slow the vehicle. merging into traffic already at highway speeds and having the model s cruise control/ autopilot slowing down will cause rear end accidents into the model s. this specific scenario was on a has happened multiple times and i have made tesla aware of  the defect/bug.  this also happens when passing under overpasses with a mph that is less than the highway speed limit. it has been 3 months and it has not been corrected. this incident happened in a cloverleaf interchange.  i have uncovered other defects of this nature and will report them in separate incidents.  all incidents have been submitted to tesla motors and to my  knowledge they are planning to correct the situation. i have more data on this such as gps location data, logs, ect if needed."

"power steering failed notice displayed upon starting parked vehicle.. 2012 ford fusion display panel said ""power steering assist failure"" and ""  service advancetrac."" when i logged in on ford owner website, it advised me of ""field service action"" titled ""epas steering efforts""  and field service action number ""15n01.""  date this began approximate, and has repeated and finally  remains failed. mileage is approximate."
while using adaptive cruise control the car will inexplicably break when it sees shadows in the road.  usually happening while traveling under a bridge on highway.   car will drop speed from 70 mph to approximately 40 mph with sudden breaking?
"vehicle shut off during driving, causing all electrical systems to fail including the electronic steering, which since vehicle also turned off, caused the steering column to lock up. since the problem occurred at speed and infact while making a turn, a near collision occured. the problem occured multiple times in succession and was also intermittent with much time elapsing between episodes. two other types of related occurrences during this timeframe were the (1) vehicle also cycling off and on and (2) would also turn on itself if the key was in the vicinity of the vehicle. toyota of seattle experienced the issues when the vehicle was brought in and diagnosed the issue to be a loose bolted connection of the negative electrical wire from the battery to the frame of the vehicle. though the vehicle has experienced similar issues since tightening of the negative wire bolts. ongoing issues include the electrical system cycling off and on while driving including the navigation and front console display.     the vehicle was bought in september 2014 and had less than 25k miles as of april 2016. on two prior instances electrical issues were identified and documented to toyota of seattle and the vehicle was kept for testing. the first electrical issue occured with the adaptive cruise control failing and thereby requiring passenger intervention to avoid collision. this cruise control failure first seemed to occur in december 2015. toyota of seattle did not find any fault and sent me away.     the second prior electrical issue of the battery prematurely failing occurred in march 2016. the readings indicated some odd draws. toyota of seattle replaced the battery and sent me away without addressing the odd draws.     the vehicle's safety remains suspect with ongoing electrical cycling off and on while driving."

"this is a complaint about the tesla autopilot.  despite warnings in the fine print that the driver should be ready to take control at any time it is clear that many drivers are using it in a dangerous and reckless manner because they are under the illusion that it is a completely fail safe true autopilot system.  the hold steering wheel nag seems to vary from car to car and changes with each software upgrade.  here are a few recent youtube videos of drivers using autopilot in a dangerous fashion.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pinpxkuwqcq  this is meant to be amusing but it is placing lives in danger.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqqte6n_ghm  70 mph hands nowhere near the wheel and not ready to take control.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaafe7i3ywq  owner places far too much faith in the autopilot.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dymfiq2ol8o  using autopilot on undivided road in heavy traffic and with misplaced confidence.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg4zgfvp0j4  on the autobahn, coffee in one hand, burger in the other hand and busy making a video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkkdzjnwta8  another driver holding a coffee and a sandwich while travelling at 60 mph.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4agxej_9g3y  a journalist who ought to know better drives hands free  inches from oncoming traffic.  i believe this is a reckless experiment that is placing lives in danger.  elon musk claims he has approval for autopilot in most countries of the world.  i find that very difficult to believe.

"my car has a variety of dangerous behaviors in the driver assist functionalities that could either cause or fail to prevent an accident.  i have only driven it 2,000 miles but observed these many times. i reported these to the dealer and was told the car was fine.    adaptive cruise control issues:  - fails to detect vehicles in odd situations, such as a truck where the rear of the body protrudes out from the rear wheels, as if the radar is only at ground level, or if a vehicle is driving in my lane but one tire is in the other lane, or a wide load which occupies all of the adjacent lane and half of my lane, or a ""bobtail"" truck.  - after an empty stretch, upon coming up to a slower car, rather than slow gradually by easing off the gas, the car will get very close to the car and then rapidly brake, causing drivers behind me to nearly rear-end me.    collision mitigation:  - all of these trigger ""brake"" messages to be displayed, which is just 1 step before the brakes being auto-applied, which could cause me to be rear-ended.  - false alarms while merging from lefthand onramps where a pending collision with the jersey barrier is detected  - false alarms by the hills adjacent to the road when going around a sharp turn on back roads  - false alarms when cresting a hill with a curve after the hill and it thinks an oncoming car will be hit, because it can't see the lane markings past the hill    lane keep assist:  - partially goes into exit ramps on its own if in the right lane, causing other drivers to think i am leaving the lane and start to merge themselves  - is confused by lines of tar and will depart the lane on its own  - often ""fights"" with the lane departure mitigation around corners  - tries to prevent me from giving other vehicles some buffer when passing them, if they are wider or drifting toward me.  - does not alert when it stops being able to detect the lines"

"i used my 2015 honda cr-v awd touring to tow a trailer with two scooters loaded.  the touring trim has the lane keeping assist system (lkas) which uses a camera to read the road markings and will bump the steering wheel if the driver is getting too close to the center or sides of the road.  i was driving on the interstate at the speed limit on a day with clear weather.  with lkas on, when the trailer would hit a bump the crv would over-correct the steering back and forth causing the trailer to sway and making it difficult to get under control. at 70 mph, it was dangerous.  i had to keep the lkas turned off to keep the vehicle safe. with lkas off, the trailer pulled great and never swayed.  it surprised me the driving experience would be vastly different with the lkas safety feature activated.    the owner's manual has no warnings about using the lkas while towing in either the lkas section or the towing section.  the closest applicable warning is if the car is overloaded the camera may not be able to see the road markings.  my trailer is in good working order.  it was well balanced side to side and front to back.  it was not overloading the hitch.  the vehicle was riding level.  the trailer and bikes weigh about 1,100 lbs.  the vehicle is rated to tow 1,500 lbs.  i had previously towed a small utility trailer with similar results.  if the trailer or how it was loaded was to blame, i would have expected to experience control issues whether the lkas was on or off.  i only experienced issues when lkas was on.    i have contacted american honda and opened case #04800645."

"my girlfriend and i were driving down the highway on a sunny day at around 70 mph. i was using adaptive cruise control. there were other cars on the road, but none within distance to affect my speed/cruise control (they were all way ahead or behind). all of a sudden, for about a half second, my truck flashed the warning light and sound as if i was going to hit something, and it automatically pressed the brake for me. it was very scary and dangerous. then it came out of the warning and we continued on our way (we were in a bit of shock). i of course turned off the adaptive cruise control so the vehicle was under my complete control. thinking back, i'm wondering if the shadow from an overpass caused my truck to think there was a vehicle close and an impending crash. either way, it was very unsafe, and i'm hoping it doesn't happen again to me, or anyone else."
"tl* the contact owns a 2011 ford fusion. the contact stated that while driving at 15 mph, the steering wheel became difficult to maneuver and required force. the vehicle was serviced under the nhtsa campaign number: 15v340000 (steering) but the remedy failed to repair the vehicle. the contact mentioned that the electric power steering assist warning light illuminated after the recall repair. the manufacturer was made aware of the failure. the vehicle failure mileage was 100,792."
"tl* the contact owns a 2013 ford f-150. when the vehicle was started, the power steering assist warning light illuminated. the vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic to be diagnosed. the mechanic was unable to retrieve a fault code. the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was made aware of the issue. the approximate failure mileage was 70,000. "
"electronic power steering assist failed several times at start up or low speed july 2016. diagnosed as internal system failure of the steering rack program. the steering rack was replaced at $1900. fortunately, i did not have highway speed failures before the error could be diagnosed and fixed. steering is exceedingly more difficult than old ""manual"" steering without the power assist."
"tl* the contact owns a 2012 ford focus. while attempting to reverse the vehicle, the power steering failed without warning and the steering assist warning light illuminated. the contact took the vehicle to dealer where it was diagnosed that the steering module failed and needed to be replaced. the vehicle was repaired. the manufacturer was made aware of the failure and informed the contact that the vin was not included in a recall. the approximate failure mileage was 90,000. updated 09/20/16*lj  *tr"
"driving my family home from a vacation, i lost my power steering on the massachusetts turnpike. the vehicle has 2557 miles on it. the dashboard indicated, ""steering assist off - service required - i was traveling at highway speed when this occurred and feared for my safety, the safety of my family and the safety of others on the turnpike. i called my dealer who referred me to ford roadside assistance. the vehicle was flat bedded in to my ford dealership.  i checked the nhtsa website to see if there were any known issues related to steering with my year and model ford. although there was none for the 2016 at this time, there was a huge recall with the 2014 ford escape for this same steering assist  issue. hopefully, nobody will go through what i did. this issue could have easily called a major accident."
"vehicle stationary, engine idling when ""power steering assist"" failure message appears, with subsequent loss of power steering.  this has happened twice within 3 day, separate occasions, after driving on interstate for approx. 1 hr, same setting. ford dealership was informed about it on the first occasion during a scheduled 80,000 mile maintenance, however they stated vehicle was ok, and ready to drive.  mileage at the time of first incident was approx. 80,947. arrival mileage at ford dealership was 81,043. on 7/13/16"
cannot hardly turn the steering wheel at stop and when driving. very dangerous when driving in busy highways.  the error message came on says that the steering assist failure.  i took it to honolulu ford where i purchased the vehicle they said since my vehicle is out of warranty i have to pay for a rack and pinion system for 2500.00 dollars to fix it.  unacceptable from a major company.
"an alert comes up on the dash board claiming that  steering assist fault service required. it is very difficult to drive although the faster i go the easier it is to steer' bit turns remain difficult     this started happening in 2015, powering off the car would temporarily fix it. the issue was intermittent but is now very consistent and happening every time i drive the car."
there has been 4 times my steering wheel becomes very hard for me to turn. it has happened once while driving and 3 times after parking and starting my car it happens. i get the message of power steering assist fault.
here is a report of a crash that occurred in germany.  http://teslaclubsweden.se/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5024    the owner is uncertain of the exact sequence of events and is not sure if he was on autopilot or not.  he credits the tesla with saving his life but does not concede that the crash might have been caused by a vehicle fault.    the rollover and crash may have been partially the fault of the truck driver but the reports are ambiguous.  both front and rear wheels have been torn off the car which may have been the result of the crash but bearing in mind the large number of crashes in which tesla wheels have snapped off it may be that this was actually the cause of the accident.  tires should not peel off the rim even during a high speed spin.  wheels and suspension assemblies should not snap off so easily.    i would like nhtsa to contact the german investigators to alert them to the possibility of autopilot or mechanical failure being a factor in this crash.  i am not a tesla owner. i am a concerned citizen that has to share the roads with tesla autopilot controlled vehicles and i believe that lives of road users are being put at risk by this unregulated experiment.      
"power steering recall - receiving ""power steering assist fault"". when in park and putting vehcile into drive, we're getting the fault message.  it is my understanding there is the same recall for 2011 ford fusions. we have 2010 ford fusion.  we are now down one vehicle as we were told it will be $2,500 to repair."
"in follow up to my original  complaint number 10885168, steering assist malfunction while operating on the massachusetts turnpike, which resulted in a loss of power steering, the dealership confirmed the vehicle needs a new steering rack at 2500 miles."
"installed new front bumpers from ranch hand corporation shiner,tx 18003669712 they said all the safety features would work and the adaptive cruise. it doesn't and a big safety issue. i just want them to honor what they said they sold and to have safety features. i called them and not very helpful at all and rush me off the phone."
"when my son was driving the vehicle the steering assist indicator light came on without notice at which time he was unable to easily steer the car. he managed to get the car into a nearby parking lot where we had the car towed to a ford dealership service center. the dealer indicated that the steer gear failed and would need to be replaced. even though there a regional customer satisfaction no 15r01, for the replacement of this gear, my repairs would not be covered under this program because the gear didn't fail as a result of fault bolts. i contacted ford motor company and and experienced great customer service in dealing with the problem, at which time i was transfered to tj brewer (thomas), the general manager for the west market. i never spoke with tj as someone named mark answered and indicated that he would be happy to get things started  for me and pass it along to tj. mark was rude and belittling. he acted like i was trying to get a free handout and told me that my request for repair for the known steer gear failure has been denied. i asked to speak with tj and mark said that he had all of the authority to approve or deny my request and that no effort of my own would over-ride his decision. i asked him if there was any manager that i could speak with and he told me that they were all busy and he would have them call me back. i have not heard from mark, tj or his manager yet. i followed up with a call into ford motor company again, where i my situation was handled expertly again but told that tj would be the last authority and have the final say on whether ford was going to do the right thing or not."
the steering assist system turns on and off at will and makes the vehicle nearly inoperable and definetly a safefty issue.

"on april 30, my husband was driving my new model x on the freeway. it was a sunny day. he disengaged autopilot to change freeways. after he changed freeways, he re-engaged autopilot. the car followed the curve on the new freeway, turning to the right, but when the freeway straightened out, the car kept turning and hit a guardrail on the right side. no warning, no braking, no stopping. tesla tells us that the autopilot was not re-engaged and was just in cruise control (i don't know how the car would be following the curve in the road then). also, that it's algorithm correctly instructed the car to hit the guardrail at full speed rather than to stop or beep a warning. at best, tesla suffers from a design flaw (how could my husband incorrectly think he was in autopilot mode; how could the algorithm make us crash when the freeway was pretty empty). at worst, tesla is covering up their mistakes."

"first of all my truck just now hit 30,000 miles. when starting the truck 3 days ago it gave us a display message of 'power steering assist fault' and we had no power steering to back out of the driveway. i turned the truck off, waited a minute then back on it didn't happen again. the next day it happened again while starting. did the same thing of turning off waiting then back on didn't do it. backed out of the driveway and while going down the street to get about 30mph it faults again and we can't steer. stop the vehicle in the middle of the road, thankfully still in our neighborhood and turn it back on. made it to work. got in truck to leave work and it happened again. same process turing it off and on. got home. then again this morning it happened again with the fault display. turned it off and on again. but this time it did it twice in a row. and had to be turned off again. took it in for a diagnostic and nothing shows up!! of course!! drove to work. had to run an errand and it did it again when i started it then again while i was driving down the street about 20mph, thankfully it wasn't too busy, i put on my hazards and turned truck off and on and finished driving. what happens when it happens on the highway? do i need to crash and kill someone or my family and kids to get a recall? the 2014 is recalled that uses same parts so i'm not sure why these aren't as well. included is the picture taken this morning when it did it again."
"power steering assist fails.  power steering assist failure flashes on the display and the vehicle becomes nearly impossible to steer.  i was backing out of my driveway when the alarm chimed, power steering assist failure flashed on the dash display, and the car was suddenly without steering.  i was able to pull back into the driveway without an accident but if this had happened on the highway going to work this would have been a catastrophe.  after checking for loose wires or other obvious defect under the hood, i decided to restart the car.  when it started there was no problem.  i decided not to drive it that day ( i also own a 2007 f-150) and took our other ford vehicle.  today when i went out to check it again the problem has returned and i can no longer drive it."
"this is a complaint about the tesla autopilot.  an owner has posted a video of a near miss that could have resulted in a fatality  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61gks0il8i0    he reported the event to the tesla motors forum.  https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/video-heres-why-you-have-to-keep-your-eyes-on-the-road-when-using-autopilot.73767/    the owner was using the autopilot in the exact same way that tesla publicity has shown him - hands ""near"" the wheel.  the discussion on the forum seeks to blame the owner and to absolve tesla of responsibility.    a minority of posters see things in a different way    ""ampedrealtor, wednesday at 1:49 am  last edited: wednesday at 2:00 am  adrien said: &#8593;  wow interesting and exactly why it's still ""beta."" no need to email tesla. any correction you did will improve the neural network automatically. that's how it get's better  this is exactly why you don't release software like this that is beta. this vehicle could have crashed into the car in the next lane and caused death or severe injury. tesla cannot hide behind the ""beta"" moniker and expect that it is not accountable in any way for the performance of a system which, by its very nature, enables a greater degree of driver distraction while doing nothing to mitigate that distraction.    all of the analysis as to why this or that happened is rather meaningless, in my opinion. the system just doesn't work if it does not require hands on the wheel and can suddenly throw you into the next lane. it sounds like the passengers were quite alarmed. maybe we should just explain to them about ""beta"" and that if they were to be maimed in a crash it's okay because the system is ""beta"" and its' neural network needs to learn some new techniques.

"i purchased a used 2012 ford focus hatchback in october 2012 that had 29,000 mile on it at the time.  i drove the vehicle up to 39,000 and the power steering failed as i was initiating a left turn across traffic.  i looked down to see the power steering assist fault error message.  the car was out of warranty at that point, and i was out 2,000$ in repairs.  i have seen that ford has recalled other vehicles for the same issue, just not the 2012 focus yet.    in october 2014, i found the hard stuttering upon accelerating and then i received my first recall notice.  a new tcm was installed, reprogrammed, along with a new clutch.  about two weeks after that the clutch failed and i had to bring it back in for repairs.  about 6 months after that i was driving on the highway at around 70 mph and the dashboard lit up with a transmission malfunction, service now error.  i took it to the dealership and they replaced the tcm again and reprogrammed.      in august 2016, the car is now at around 65,000 miles.  i was driving around 40 mph on a busy city street when i received the transmission malfunction, service now error.  i just got the car back from the dealership yesterday, the 4th time, with a new tcm that has been reprogrammed.    this car is unsafe, and ford is aware.  the technicians i have dealt with all know the exact issue before i explain it to them.  i asked for a complaint line, or any options for consumers in my position and was told by both the dealership and the ford customer service hot line that there are none.  i asked the technician at the dealership if they knew they were handing me an unsafe vehicle, and he shook his head then stated he wished there was something they could do but i am out of luck."

"power steering fails without warning and displays the fault message ""steering assist fault: service required"". failure makes steering very difficult and can result in loss of control. dealership identified the cause as a internal failure of the pscm (power steering control module) and replaced the pscm and rack and pinion assembly to repair. please note that earlier model year ford escapes have a similar problem and have been recalled under nhtsa campaign number: 14v284000 and ford recall number 14s05. as this issue is identical to the prior recall, i strongly suggest adding the 2013 model year ford escape vehicles to the recall.    the most common time for the power steering to fail was right after startup and maneuvering out of a parking spot on a city street or garage. at this low speed manual steering is difficult and aggressive braking is required to avoid an accident once the inability to setter is apparent to the driver.    once the steering fails and the fault message appears, it could be occasionally reset by shutting down the engine and restarting the car. turning off a car on a public road to regain steering control is undesirable and unsafe.    i spoke with both ford customer service and the ford dealership and both claimed that there are no tsbs or recalls describing the loss of power steering  for the 2013 ford escape. the repair invoice (attached) shows that the dealership verified the failure of the power steering control module (as in prior recalls of earlier model years) and the need to replace the pscm and entire pscm/rack and pinion assembly. the mileage at the time of repair was 45281. the fault occurred intermittently at earlier mileages and became more frequent with increasing mileage up until the time of repair to to safety concerns.

"2014 jeep grand cherokee auto brakes for no reason, it sensed a stopped vehicle in the left turning lane and slammed on the brakes twice, i was in the left lane going 35 miles per hour; this has happened in the past also. i did report this to the manufacturer about six months ago via email, i saved the emails and their response. i could have been rear ended by a vehicle behind me because of this problem, literally once it starts i have no control over what the vehicle does, there is no way to stop the jeep from braking. i shudder to think if it happened on a freeway. i was traveling on a straight road going 35 miles per hour in the left lane.    on the evening of 8/22/2016 i was driving in the dark and my automatic high beams malfunctioned several times.  they used to work perfectly now they stay on and blind oncoming drivers and the drivers ahead of me, they also fail to come one when i am in the dark and there are no other cars; both incidents of high beam malfunction happened on a country road and on the freeway last night. this problem started immediately after i had the electronic shifter updated at the dealer and some other software updates that were due but i don't know what they did, i just know they were software related and part of a recall.      said vehicle is going back to the dealer for several hours of work on the software for both the high beams an the braking system on thursday, august 25, 2016."

lost power steering assist while driving vehicle at approx. 35mph. it was all i could do just to get it back home. i couldn't even turn it to get into my garage!  i did some research on this problem and found that a recall had been issued for vehicle years 2008-2011. i called the dealer and was told that my vehicle was not included in this recall since it was manufactured on may 26 2011. my problem is: i'm having the identical problem and who's to say that these parts weren't manufactured at the same time the defective ones were?

"on april15, 2015 i took my 2014 chevrolet ss, mileage 6316, to the dealer in response to factory recall 14804. at that time they applied a dielectetic lube to the steering rack connector as per the recall instructions. this was to prevent a sudden loss of power steering while operating the vehicle. this condidtion had not ever occured at that time. one year later in april 2016 the car started experiencing sudden loss of power steering at random times. the vehicle drivers information center stated ""service power steering, drive with care"". all power steering assist was gone and stopping and restarting the motor was the only way to restore it, maybe for a few minutes, maybe for the rest of the day. the car was then parked in our garage until mid august 2016. the car continued the sudden loss of power steering and i took the car to the dealer on 9-1-2016. mileage 16031. took a picture of the d.i.c.  screen as evidence of the steering loss. dealer stated no codes were set and performed the lube procedure under recall 14804 again. i was told to bring car back with power steering malfunctioning. my concern is the loss of power steering dramatically increases the effort needed to steer the further the wheel is turned. if it were to fail on a cloverleaf interstate onramp the effort to steer would be very high, coupled with the higher speeds, a recipe for disaster. i would like to have the steering rack replaced. first recall repair procedure didn't fix the vehicle, second identical repair procedure surely will not. concerns about this condition exist in nhtsa document id# 10057679."

this a complaint about the tesla autopilot.  this video has just been uploaded.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcc7jh8ux-e    here is an owner  driving hands free  at high speed while waving his arms around and even crossing his arms across his chest.  the irresponsible marketing and promotion of the tesla autopilot has encouraged this kind of behavior.  whilst an inquiry into the autopilot is still in progress tesla is planning to roll out yet another version beta release.  i believe that is another attempt to shift the goal-posts and sidestep the inquiry.  the prudent thing would be to disable the autopilot until it is proven to be safe.  
"i was driving on the highway and the steering started to become very difficult if i wanted to switch lanes or if there was a curve in the road.  i took the vehicle to an auto repair shop and they diagnosed the issue as the power steering assist motor was starting to fail.  they told me that if it was not fixed, it could completely fail and cause my vehicle to get into an accident."

here is another complaint about the tesla autopilot.  here is a recently uploaded video of a tesla employee giving a customer a test drive and demonstration of autopilot.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbcx2o-otso  the demonstrator is only playing lip-service to the requirement that drivers should keep hands on the wheel.  he assures the driver that the autopilot is perfectly safe and allows him to take his hands off the wheel and drive while distracted.  he even reaches over and puts his hands through the spokes of the steering wheel to perform an automatic lane change without even glancing in the mirror.  if this is the kind of instruction being given to new owners then the situation will only get worse when the new owner becomes overconfident in the system and perhaps instructs his partner or other people to have a go at letting autopilot take care of everything.  the problem is not just that the system is flawed but that the way it is being pitched to customers is reckless in the extreme.  please stop this experiment immediately.    
this is yet another complaint about the autopilot.  please watch this video in full. it shows how an intelligent and well educated driver chooses to use the autopilot without having any idea that he is placing his own life and that of other road users in  extreme danger.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55a7nzxvtrq  he chooses to drive with one hand near the wheel because actually placing hands on the wheel causes too many disconnections of the autopilot.  he thinks he will have time to take over control if something goes wrong.  he passes inches away from oncoming traffic on undivided roads with a combined speed of greater than 200 km/h.  even after the recent fatal accident caused by autopilot owners have been told by elon musk that autopilot is safer than human drivers.  this is simply untrue.  other road users did not give permission for their lives to be placed at risk by a three ton  car  being driven towards them hands free.  the driver in this video is not to be blamed for believing that it is safe to drive in this fashion.  tesla is to blame for exaggerating the capabilities and the safety of the autopilot.  this autopilot has been released all over the world.  it is constantly being altered by software updates.  none of the cars that have had autopilot enabled over the air have been put through testing to ensure that all sensors and other hardware is working correctly.  please stop this experiment before more people are killed.
"as i was coming to a stop, the steering got really difficult and the steering assist light came on. after stopping, the steering locked up completely. i restarted the car, and it worked after that. now i'm worried this will happen in a worse area, particularly while on the freeway. i also recently had the passenger door open while i was driving and had to tie the seat belt through the door handle and hold to make it home without the door coming open. locking the seat belt in still made the door barely open, and the alert go off. this looks like it was just recalled, so i'm hoping i get reimbursed. it wasn't cheap to fix. car is 114,000 miles."
"with no consistency in timing, the power steering has been going out. i may be driving, turning or waiting at a stop light, on city streets or the highway. this problem started in may 2016, happening 1-2 times per month. i took it into my local ford dealer and they said there was nothing wrong. they thought it could be a problem with the steering rack, but weren't sure. they denied that my vehicle was included in ford's recall of several 2011 and 2012 fusions for the same problem. now (september 2016), the power steering is going out 1-2 times per day. the ""power steering assist fault"" and ""service advanctrac"" error messages appear. i feel this is a serious safety issue for me and the other drivers on the road, and ford should be responsible for their design flaw."
dynamic cruise control turn itself off or applies brakes    this has happened multiple times on tangent sections with no vehicles in front - highway speed (70 mph).  there is a series of beeps and the car slows gradually or abruptly.  dashboard indicator shows there is a vehicle in front but no vehicle is present - false positive.      took vehicle to toyota dealer and he stated that when pcs was disabled it would remedy the problem.  it did not.    returned to toyota dealer - he checked with toyota corporate and they have no record of any problems like this.    problem normally occurs on longer trips after driving 2-3 hours.  dynamic cruise cannot be reset for an hour or two.  you must either drive manually or use normal cruise control mode for an hour or two and then you can return to dynamic cruise control.    error has now occured at least 6 times since pcs has been disabled and 3x before it was disabled.  date below is the latest occurence.
"here is another complaint about the tesla autopilot to draw attention to the way in which owners are behaving in real life.  the proposed upgrades to the autopilot will do nothing to prevent the behavior shown in this video.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeu5ol2ir4m    in common with the self-reported behavior of owners on the forums, drivers are driving hands free except for giving the wheel a gentle tweak just often enough to prevent the hold wheel nag.  90% of the time it is hands free.  the system does guard against the driver having totally fallen asleep but it does not cause him to keep hands on the wheel at all times to ensure safe control of the vehicle.  if there is any malfunction of the autopilot or a mechanical failure or blown tire this hands free driving can kill in an instant.  i am not trying to be a know all. i am trying to counter the false confidence that has been created in the  autopilot and the unwillingness of tesla owners to desist from hands free driving."

"this is the second time this happened to me while driving my 2016 explorer limited. my car has every option available. a few months ago as i was turning onto the highway a ""lane keeping sys malfunction"" alert came across my display and my steering locked in place. i could not turn my steering wheel at all. i had a sketchy vehicle for my first vehicle and knew that i needed to put the car in park and turn it off for a few seconds and restart the car. doing this freed my steering wheel and i was able to drive to the dealership. the dealership ran diagnostics and came to the conclusion that the sensitivity was set too high. ffw months later. 9/13/16 i am driving back at about 65 mph,  from a dr. apt on a busy road and the car tells me my steering is malfunctioning to service my vehicle. my game plan was to pull over safely and run a vehicle health report and call the dealer. seconds later i get the same message along with lane keeping malfunction & my steering locked. i had to come to a complete stop on the middle of a busy hwy with a car coming at my rear and throw it in park and kill my engine and restart my car for the steering to unlock. i spoke with the service dept. after they ran diagnostics and my vehicle is ""spitting out codes like crazy"" and was told it may be a module in my computer that controls steering & lane keeping systems or my key fob is not being detected by my computer and is not sending an alert and my car thinks it is being stolen. crazy. definitely not safe. this is my daily driver. i have 4 small children. i live in my car. please research this and issue a recall. this is not safe at all. thankfully i was not on an interstate going 70+ mph. also my car was purchased dec 2015 and was a dealer trade from a tx dealer."
must we wait for more deaths before the tesla autopilot is banned?  here is a new video from russia? showing the driver placing lives in danger.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm_5oeidd_e    here is a video showing the death of a young man in china and the effect this tragedy has on his family.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rsiek9afug  the victim was an intelligent and successful man who was using the autopilot in just the way that it has been marketed as being capable.  lives are at risk all over the world and tesla has been slow to come forward with reports of crashes.  please stop this experiment immediately.  
"here is  further proof that there is a design and/or materials problem with tesla's suspensions.  this was posted today on the official tesla motors forum.  https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/model-x-front-suspension-failure    condensed version of post:  yesterday, i was parking my model x90d in the parking garage at work, i was making a sharp turn as i was backing into a parking spot (in manual mode, not autopark), when i heard a bang and my steering became stiff. when i tried moving the car, it felt like it wouldn't want to move. when i moved forward, the car front part felt like it was lifted up an inch or so. i stopped, got out, got onto my knees and crawled under the front suspension to see what was going on. it was obvious to me that there was a front suspension failure. the wheel appeared to contact the wheel well. i refrained from making any further movement as the wheel well was acting as a giant brake on the tire.    this morning, got a call from the service center, they confirmed that the driver side control arm had cracked and was broken. . as a precaution they are replacing the control arm on the passenger side too..    i am surprised that the control arm cracked as the fatigue cycles on the part would have been low. i think when one is making an extreme turn, the control arm will be most stressed and it appears the stress analysis done may not have fully captured the loads during the extreme turn. i was driving at less than 5 mph while reverse parking when it failed. i shudder to think what could have happened if this failure occurred as i was on an expressway at speed, taking a turn/on a curved exit ramp, possibly made worse if i was on autopilot.    please do not give tesla any more benefit of the doubt but instead take immediate action to prevent loss of life."

"i was driving back from the gym on 9/15/16 when i got an error on the dashboard saying ""steering assist malfunction."" at that time my focus was in motion on a city street at approximately 45 mph and approaching a turn that i needed to take. this was highly dangerous and impaired most of my ability to steer and almost caused an accident as i was trying to steer the turn. this is highly dangerous, and from hundreds of reviews online many 2012 ford focus owners are having the exact same issue. this is something that not only needs to be investigated, but need to be recalled for the safety of all ford focus drivers."
"while turning left to enter a very narrow garage entrance i needed to determine whether or not i had to straighten out before pulling in or if my left turn was tight enough to pull in without reversing to straighten out. i saw that i was in the position that i could continue into the garage and lightly pressed the accelerator to finish my turn into the garage.     it was at this point that the car accelerated with extreme force and within a second slammed into a large concrete pole that was just inside the garage to the left.    i never felt the car slow in that moment, only speed up and i believe the car slammed into the pole while accelerating and would have continued to accelerate if not for the large pole.     i did not have either foot depressed on either pedal at the moment of collision. the air bags did not deploy, but there was very severe damage to the front end of the car that will be at least $25k.    i was not on the phone or distracted in any way. i was driving carefully and paying full attention. this is not a case of mistaken pedal because i was intending to accelerate.     at first tesla told us over the phone that their logs show that the driver pressed the pedal 100% and then tapped the brake before impact. this explanation sounded physically impossible because the distance covered was less than 3 car lengths. a month later tesla sent a letter stating the driver pressed the accelerator 100% until the vehicle sensed a crash. tesla did not respond to our query about why their log story had changed. tesla also refused to provide data about accelerator/brake percentage and car speed for the car earlier in the day. if a driver is pressing the pedal 100% it is a very deliberate action.     this is a failure of the accelerator and the automatic braking. the car accelerated on its own and crashed full force into a large concrete pole."

"turned on vehicle and power steering fault message came on. had no steering assistance and turning wheel extremely difficult. turned car on/off and it went away. it did it again a few days later but while driving residential at 25 mph in a neighborhood. stopped in the middle of the road and turned off/on vehicle, fault went away and steering returned. took to ford for diagnostics and repair. was told no faults store in the power steering module therefore warranty will not pay for diagnostics and repair. was told if it happens again, drive vehicle to dealer and do not turn off. i told the dealer this is a safety concern and they should never recommend to drive a vehicle with no power steering assistance. the dealer refused to do any further diagnostics and could not recommend safe future steps. refusing to pay for warranty on a system with no faults that does not store fault codes is unreasonable. the car is unsafe for my wife to operate yet they took no steps to correct concern. the module programming was updated but advisor described the update and it does not address my issue."
an even more dangerous development in the autopilot experiment.  this man has collected a rental tesla to perform his pranks.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmvoalpqhjc  just as soon as he drives away from the hire depot and on an undivided busy road he engages autopilot and goes hands free whilst taliking to the camera.  every customer that rents one of these cars is likely to do the same thing.  this is a matter of life and death.  please do not wait any longer to complete your investigation of autopilot.  have this system disabled right now until it can be proven to be safe.

"driving on i-40, about 150 miles from my destination on july 31, 2016, the ""service power steering soon"" light came on in the car.  i finished the drive home with no problem and turned the car off to unload it.  when i re-started it, the car reported a complete steering failure, and the power steering assist simply quit.  i looked online and saw that this has been a consistent problem with the ford steering system in the c-max and other models.  i arranged to have the issue examined & repaired at my local ford dealer.  i drove the car there, with extensive effort required to turn the wheel.  the dealer determined that the steering unit had failed, with approximately 35,000 miles on the vehicle.  my cost was approximately $1880, and i do have the receipt.  ford refused to acknowledge this as a manufacturer's defect and i was forced to pay the full amount.    i believe this known defect creates an unsafe situation.  1.  ford should be held responsible to fix this defect as it is far more common that acceptable, and 2.  they should change what happens to a car when the problem is detected.  had i not had a lot of strength, i could have gotten into an accident trying to get it in for repair.  the system worked just fine for 150 miles, so there was no real issue stopping the steering assist...until i turned it off and then the car disabled its steering.  ford should not be allowed to let the car continue to drive after the car self-disables its power steering.  it was only self-disabled after i shut it off, so it was actually still safely driveable, but the car's computer apparently decided to create the dangerous situation by shutting off the epas system completely, yet leave the car drivable.  please investigate this failure and compel ford to address the steering unit failure issue and reimburse those of us who have been forced to pay for the repair."

"warning light came on stating ""steering assist fault"". . we lost all power steering while driving the car. we were able to get the car into a rest area off the highway.  we had no power steering and it made it very difficult to operate the car. the steering gear needed to be replaced at 36,900 miles at a cost of $2,121.74. ford customer service was no help at all to me. they were suppose to return calls within 4 hours and it took me 10 days until i was able to get a call back.there currently is no recall but 900 miles past warranty i would not expect this to happen."

"while driving the electrical power steering assist failed (dashboard indicator and loss of power steering). this has happened about eight (8) times. when this occurs the vehicle becomes almost impossible to navigate, on two occasions almost leading to accidents. in this condition the vehicle poses a serious personal and public safety risk. i took the vehicle to my local ford dealer (metro ford of madison, wi) who kept it for four (4) days. they stated from the very beginning that they know nothing about the steering problem, tested the car for four days and charged me $150.00 for test that produced no results. within two (2) hours to picking up the vehicle the electric power steering system failed multiple times. ford needs to issue a recall and replace the electric power steering system immediately at no cost to the owner. or just buy the vehicle back from the owner. i believe this vehicle poses a great public danger."

"i purchased the tesla model s on 10/17 with 'autopilot' hardware and features  i've consistently used autopilot on the highway during the first month i've had the vehicle. the autopilot feature uses cameras and sensors to maintain speed and lane and avoid collisions. this car also features anti-collision features that are supposed to engage even when autopilot is not engaged, to detect both an object in front of the car and brake, as well as detect objects on either side that the car may be headed to collide with and swerve away. this features were all enabled at time of the accident.  at the time of accident, i had autopilot engaged for approx 10 minutes prior to accident. i was still watching the road but periodically looking at my phone as well.  before the accident i had looked down at my phone for a period of time i'm not sure about. i didn't think it was longer than a few seconds, but i can't be certain. when i looked up the semi was merging in front of me. i would guess that the semi's trailer was perhaps 3-4 feet in my line, and i was maybe 50-100 feet away. so it was less than 1 second prior to impact. it was so quick there was no time for me to even hit the brake and the car was not braking or swerving to avoid collision either.    essentially, the auto pilot drove me right into the left rear of a semi tractor trailer at 70 mph and the sensors/cameras for some reason did not detect this collision. *tr"

failure of the steering column flexible coupling.-  i was driving on the highway when this occurred- this caused my car to lose driving control - i had knocking sound in the steering wheel and it was very difficult to control the driving.  the part is a small rubber coupling that is located inside of the power steering assist motor.   the part appears to be the manufacturer default (it was made of soft rubber) - hyundai has developed a new replacement part that is made of a harder rubber the new part # 56315-2k000-fff.  everyone that has a hyundai sonata 2011 should have this flexible coupling replaced to prevent losing control of the automobile. at a minimum car owner should be notified of the possibility of this happening when driving.   this does not appear to be in normal  routine maintenance issue.  *tr

"the tesla autopilot is not only a feature that does not work, it is seriously dangerous.  the new version 8 software is actually more dangerous than version 7.  the car regularly steers out of its lane and does not detect cars to either side that are less than 2 car lengths in front of the vehicle.  the same defect applies to cars on its rear wings.  i have had several instances where cars have either cut in front of my vehicle or have come very close to the side of the vehicle without the car adjusting or braking at all.  i have given the feature many opportunities (>100) and can say for certain that it would have caused an accident on a significant percentage of occasions, if i had not intervened in time.  the emergency braking feature is also ineffective, and only works in very limited circumstances.  i can compare this to the audi system, which is excellent and fully functional.  the issues are hardware related which tesla have just understood, announcing that future cars will have hardware that works.  existing vehicles will only get software upgrades that will not correct the issues.  i have videos that show cars are not detected, so can prove it is impossible to fix with software.  this must be considered a recall on the vehicle so that the feature can be corrected and the safety improved to acceptable levels.    i have owned the vehicle since august, 2016 and the issues i have described have occurred between august and november., 2016.  i am filing this complaint now as the system is labeled 'beta' so i was aware that improvements were needed.  this week tesla announced that all new vehicles will have hardware that addresses the problems, but that this will not be replaced on existing vehicles."

"this complaint pertains to adaptive cruise control (acc), forward crash avoidance (fca) and lane departure warning systems (ldws).  i have been driving this specific vehicle but it will pertain to all vehicles with these systems. the acc and fcas because of its straight line of sight is misinterpreting the data on approach to bridges, overpasses and overhead signs and will initiate a hard braking event on the interstate when no braking is required causing the potential to lose control and for a following vehicle to crash. this problem would be intensified on wet, icy and snow covered roads.   i have also experienced a hard braking event on interstates on approach to a curve in the road where vehicles ahead will already be in the curve in another lane and the data is misinterpreted as a crash and brakes hard because the other vehicles are directly in the line of sight. again, no braking was required.  on approach to a vehicle on the highway ready to move into another lane to execute a passing maneuver the vehicle is braked forcing a loss in vehicle momentum when no braking was required.  in inclement weather, rain, snow, frost and fog the sensors become unable to see which is the best thing that could happen and the only way to disable it that i know of.   these events occur every single day on my trips. i am a professional driver with 35 years' experience in commercial vehicles and 40 in a car. i drive 570 miles a night. these technologies in their current state have no place in vehicles on the public highway systems. with winter coming i am very concerned for my safety and that of the motoring public and want a record of my complaint on file. truck is equipped with the detroit assurance 2.0 system."

"while driving my 2014 audi s4 on the highway and in turns, the steering goes from feeling tight to very light and back to tight again within a matter of split seconds.  this causes drifting on the highway and when cornering because you're compensating for the lack of feeling for an instant and using more input than you  should, then the steering gets tight again and your car steers more than  it should have.  note that the car goes straight when hands are not on the wheel.  this is most prevalent at times when the steering wheel is in the straight position.  this seems to be due to  the movement of the steering wheel that happens under the force of the drivers hands as the steering assist level fluctuates.  the car does not want to stay centered when going straight and hands are resting on the wheel.  there seems to be excessive assist at or near the top dead center.  note that this is an intermittent issue.  it might be driving fine, then i turn off the engine to fill up with gas for example, re-start the engine and the problem presents itself.   i took the car to my local audi dealer on 14dec2016 at 42,430 miles (this has been happening since i purchased the car with approx. 9,000 miles) to diagnose  the issue.  the technician who took it for a test drive could not reproduce the issue on that day nor the next day from what they told me.  they mention on their invoice that they suspect it could be grooved roads causing it even though i stressed to them that this happens at high speeds and is very dangerous to drive.  i was forced nearly into a tractor trailer on the highway one day and that scared me enough to finally address this issue.  also, i had discussed the issue with another technician at the dealer and he said that he had a similar issue with his 2013 audi s4 and sold the car because of the steering problems.  audi says the car is functioning normally.  *tr"

"at start, vehicle shows power steering assist failure and because vehicle is parked, almost impossible to turn steering wheel - started 2 months ago as intermittent problem, then permanent failure now.  issue has not occurred, yet, while driving this vehicle.  vehicle subject to recall 14v286000 - evaluated in oct 2014 when no faults or dtcs were showing up - dealer said software updated per recall actions - dtc is now u3000 which is the replace gear code.  prior evaluation wasno replacement needed then because no faults were showing which appears to be a useless recall action that did nothing to prevent safety issue.  even though the safety recall item (dtc u3000) is now occurring 2 years after initial evaluation, dealer & ford will do nothing.  why is your recall # 14v286000 so useless?  *tr"
"i was driving at 6:20 am on the new jersey turnpike. i was in the left lane and going approximately 70 mph using the scc (smart cruise control). all of the sudden, the lights start flashing and the car completely turns off. since it was before sunrise, everything was black and i couldn't even see where i was driving, not to mention that the steering wheel became locked. 10 seconds later, the care came back to ""life"". it did that same intro with the ""system check"" thing as it does when the car is started from a park position- only i was on the highway going 70 mph.    i have never heard of something so absurd, but i guarantee that if this was during rush hour or a busier time during the day- there would have been a major accident!  *tr"

"power steering assist is not working. when your moving slow in the vihicle it's very hard to turn the steering wheel, when i took my dodge ram 3500 in for an oil change the dealership said that it was because the power steering assist is not working and that is why you are unable to turn the wheel while sitting or moving very slow. so it makes it almost impossible to pull out of a parking spot.  i'm a disabled person so it's very difficult to pull in and out of parking spots, so i drive around to find spots that can be pulled straight into and out of."

the power steering assist failure warning light flashed 3 times and then my power steering went out.  it was in motion on a city street.  we had the car towed to a dealership.    the torque sensor that was previously covered on the recall from july 2014 failed.  ford is refusing to fix the sensor stating that the recall was fulfilled even though the sensor was not replaced.   the dealership mentioned that they have had the same issue with other vehicles under the same recall.  i have attached a letter that was sent to ford on our behalf.
"while traveling through snow and ice the front grill of the vehicle became covered with a coating of ice. this blocked the front radar device from working. therefore shutting down the cruise control system and the automatic collision detection system which brakes the vehicle when getting to close to a vehicle in front. this condition persisted even after passing through the storm because the temperature was at freezing or below. this occurred while traveling on a highway. the ice on the grill only melted after stopping, and the cruise control and automatic braking system return to normal. would this ice build-up on the front grill also cause a problem with the radiator and the cooling system?"

"power steering assist failed, almost locking up steering while stationery. vehicle could not be driven as too many force is needed to move the steering wheel. this is the infamous electronic power assist system (epas) on many recent fords that are failing left and right. the system replacement part is about $1,300 (the whole thing new, as it can not be repaired) + $700 labor = a $2,000+ repair. ford has decided to recall some vehicles (2011 and newer) but others not (2010 or earlier), leaving owners like myself stranded, as these epas usually fail after the warranty expires. i own a 2010 taurus sho, on these particular 2010 and earlier systems, which appear to be an earlier generation, when the epas fails, steering becomes hard as a rock, you simply can not drive the car. this is very concerning if it happens while driving.  unfortunately, ford has been hiding, and even they have been investigated, they claim that even when the epas fails, you still should be able to steer your car and be able to drive it with just a little more effort.  this is half true. that is the case with the 2011 and newer epas systems, which you can see demonstrated here: https://youtu.be/su5fd_w5hxm?t=1m53s  but for 2010 and earlier, that is not the case, as this fellow demonstrate: https://youtu.be/szhmxwcp9fo  so, this issue is really affecting pre 2010 owners, which appear to have a 1st gen epas i guess, since the two behave differently when they fail.  ford should be investigated as to why they recalled 2011 and newer but did not recalled 2010 and earlier. the two systems are different, and the pre-2010 is a more concerning issue, as it involves a total steering loss of the car.  *tr"
"-all started with loud pop, metal failure sound.  -at a stop, with brakes applied, the power steering turns the wheel to the right.  i have to pull to the left to keep the wheel centered. (not moving) this pressure issue will finally stop and the wheel will center on it's own.  -steering has slop, feels loose, dead center  -while at speed applying the brakes the  steering wheel was torn from my hand 3 times.  the power steering causes truck to change directions when braking.  99% of the time the truck turns right.  the hyroboost system is turning the steering system to the right which changes the direction of the truck.  -while driving the power steering assist appears to turn off and on.  as if there is a power loss or too much power was applied than it returned to normal.      the truck has been at the dealer 3 different times.  first dealer visit the tech deemed the truck unsafe to drive.  this was determined by just driving the truck from the service lane to the garage.  tech identified a gm tsb (pit5501d) to investigate the issue and contact gm.  gm outlined a repair however the repairs did not resolve the issue.  i was told by the dealer to take it to another dealer for a second opinion.  this was after returning to the dealer for the second time and stating the steering system is now leaking and the issue still remains with some improvement.    3rd visit at the 2nd dealer:  second dealer drove the truck with me and it was difficult to control. the dealer tech was driving and i was sitting in the passenger seat. they deemed it unsafe to drive and put me in a loaner.  2nd dealer identified metal in the steering fluid and parts that contain fluid must be replace.    personal thoughts are the steering boxes are factory defective and causing them to fail over time.  this then introduces metal into the hydroboost system which results in brake and steering failure.  *tr"

"my son was driving south on i-15 towards san diego at 65mph in the travel lane (2nd left most lane) when his new truck suddenly and without warning completely shut itself off. the main screen on the dash prompted to shift into park (the truck was traveling at 65 mph at the time) to restart the truck. he was unable to pull over to the left due to the hov lane being very busy - he traversed three lanes of traffic to the right in a vehicle without power, or steering assist, and an inoperable electrical system. the blinker column switch did not activate the indicator lights. he was able to activate the emergency hazard flasher lights to show his emergent need to stop on the right shoulder.      he stopped the truck near  exit 31 on i-15 south. he was able to shift the truck into park and restart the truck.     he was forced to continue driving the truck to nas north island san diego  because he was on the flight schedule for a annual flight evaluation pre- deployment.     the vehicle failure could easily have resulted in a fatality if another driver, less able to handle unforeseen dangerous mechanical failures, could have panicked in crowded california traffic.     my son states that he has lost confidence in the vehicle, moreover that it is dangerous to the vehicle occupants and individuals who might be involved in a crashed caused by the sudden failure of the vehicle systems."
"in july,, 2016 the ""steering assist fault"" sensor light came on as i was backing out of driveway.  i was unable to turn wheel.  the car was towed to dealership where purchased where they found a ""faulty steering rack"" that, i assume was repaired.  today, march 8, 2017 i was parking the vehicle in town and the ""steering assist fault"" sensor light came on again.  i was unable to turn the wheel.  it was, again, towed to the same dealership.  luckily, both times i was not in traffic but  on a side street.  if this had happened while on a highway or a major road things may have turned out differently and could have been life-threatening."
"took my car in for the recall back in 2014. i was told that if it was not out, that all they could do is reprogram it and that when it does go out they will replace it then. now 2 1/2 yrs later, on my way to work, my dashboard displayed ""power steering assist fault"" and my steering went out. i took it to the dealership today and they told me that it was throwing code # b2278, which is the steering shaft torque sensor, and that i had to contact ford about the recall since i didn't have any open recalls for my vehicle. the lady with ford told me that the recall was a one-n-done deal and since they reprogrammed it in 2014, there is nothing they can do. i asked her for the # to file a complaint and she told me that all complaints, either by phone or e-mail, comes through their office and i will get the same answer from anybody who received it. i can understand a one-n-done if they replace it, but all they did was prolong the breakdown. they knew it was bad, so why just reprogram it. that's not fixing anything. my son was driving the car just hours before i got in it and it went out. thank god it didn't happen to my son, who has only been driving for 1 1/2 yrs."

this is a complaint about the tesla autopilot.  here is a video that was just uploaded to youtube:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ypldhvwuy    the video shows drivers using the autopilot hands free for long periods in totally unsafe situations.  the driver is cleaning his glasses and sprawling sideways in his seat whilst passing oncoming cars and motorbikes only inches away.  how is this even possible?  owners are being duped into believing that the autopilot is capable of full autonomous operation.  please terminate this reckless experiment before more innocent lives are lost.  thank you.  concerned citizen.  
"this is another complaint about the tesla autopilot.  forum members have been discussing how easy it is to defeat the autopilot ""nags"" by hanging a weight on the steering wheel.  this video shows someone doing just that:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3ypldhvwuy  in the first 4 minutes of the clip the driver gets a nag every 3 minutes approx.  then the owner's son takes over and he has clipped a pink weight to the center spoke of the steering wheel.  the car is then driven for about 20 minutes on narrow winding roads whilst the driver fools around paying zero attention to the road.  when he enters a long stretch of straight road he need to nudge the wheel because the inertia of the weight has little effect.  owners are lead to believe that the autopilot is 40% safer than a human because  nhtsa has published this as a fact (based on data supplied by tesla)  owners now feel justified in defeating the nags with a strategically placed weight and feel confident that it is entirely safe to do so.  can you see a problem here?  concerned citizen shaking his head in disbelief.  thank you.

"while driving with cruise control engaged and a signal light is used , cruise is disengaged or if the windows are rolled up or down then cruise will be disengaged. this action will also cause the instrument cluster to dim when the signal is used or windows rolled up or down. if i turn the vehicle off and restart the vehicle it will clear up and may go another hour before it does it again. this is getting progressively worse and sometimes flashes a warning in the drivers information center,stabilitrak disabled and steering assist disabled drive with caution. again if i turn the vehicle off and  restart it it will work just fine for a while. this does seem to happen more when i have driven the vehicle for at least one hour. this started happening approx 6 months ago with cruise being disengaged and the dash lights dimming while using the signal lights or the window switch. the stabilitrak and steering warnings started 03/19/2017. on 03/20/2017 i had driven the vehicle about 2 miles and was pulling into a parking spot at a low speed when the steering wheel was ripped from my hands. the last incident was on april 8th while pulling a trailer with the tow haul mode engaged. i was attempting to pass a vehicle and kicked the vehicle into passing gear when the stabilitrak and steering warning both came on ."
"power steering assist failure.  drove to work fine, 8 hours later came out to go home and the power steering would not work.  turned off the car and all electronics in hopes it was just a boot error with no success. the error was ""power steering assist failure."" had to have car towed due to it not being highway safe.  recalls for power steering on other models after failure."
"power steering assist failed (warning appeared on dash) and vehicle was very hard to steer at low speeds, especially when turning.  i almost ran into a curb because of this failure and the effort required to turn the steering wheel.  after shutting off the vehicle and restarting it, the fault warning went away and the power steering worked.  the power steering later failed and the fault warning reappeared.  the local dealer cannot get it into service for a week and i am hesitant to drive the vehicle at speed for fear of loss of power steering again. research has indicated that this is a common problem with these vehicle.  it is a safety issue and should be covered under a recall notice."
"vehicle was stationary when i turned the car on. steering column locked up and the car started beeping and presented the warning ""system check steering assist fault service required."" this only happens when the vehicle is stationary and not in motion. in order to stop the above issue, i had to turn the car off and back on and then the steering would unlock."

2010 ford fusion se. i lost power steering assist while driving.  after pulling over i restarted the car but the issue remained i now only have manual steering. my wife and i stopped by the dealer we were told that ford does not have any recalls listed for our model .but after researching i see that 2011 and up have been recalled for the electronic assist power steering.
"dash lights would flicker along with headlights. when you would turn the wheel, the entire dash would go out like you turned off the key and then come right back on. sometimes the truck would die in the road and died while turning and created near misses for accidents. when the system would come back on, it would disable the steering assist and cause the steering wheel to jerk back towards center. took the truck to the dealer with video evidence of problem and they advised there was not recalls, service bulletins or even knowledge of a problem and wanted to charge $128.00 per hour flat rate to trouble shoot the problem. after doing some research at home, i found numerous issues with the same problems on forums and related back to a known ground issue under the dash that is labeled g218 where insulation or material is found under the ground nut creating a higher resistance. i was able to remove this material myself and correct the problem with no further issues.   the scary part about this is, my daughter had the truck die on her a couple times in the middle of traffic and was almost in a wreck because of it. gm refuses to accept their responsibility on this when it is a gm manufacture problem."
electronic power steering assist fault indicated. electronic power assist steering (epas) not functioning. epas system fault indicated while driving at 35 mph. epas quit functioning entirely and steering became difficult without the assist. accident was barely avoided. epas will not reset and i was told by a ford dealership there are currently 8 cars in the u.s. that they cannot diagnose or reprogram. therefore i have an otherwise good vehicle that is undrivable.

"multiple problems with the forward collision warning (fcw) and adaptive cruise control (acc) systems  1) system will issue false brake warnings (and apply brakes if enabled) on clear straight roads with no other cars or obstructions.  2) system will disable itself at random intervals disable itself for a period of time (10-20 minutes). only notification is brief ""fcw/acc system disabled"" notification in gauge cluster - no audio warning that important safety system disabled itself.  3) when using acc, when vehicle resumes set speed after autonomous braking, vehicle will accelerate into back of next vehicle ahead - have to manually intervene and apply brakes to prevent collision.    note that this vehicle uses a bosch lrr3 radar sensor system for the fcw and acc features.    vehicle has been into jeep dealers for service for this issue five times, and even after opening star case with jeep/chrysler fca, still no fix for this serious safety issue."

after being stalled in traffic for over an hour i pulled into a gas station and started my vehicle to leave. immediately i could feel something wrong with my steering and my alert popped on and said peer steering assist warning. called dealership and they said it's a common for the electric component to fail after idling.  they said that's this has happened to people as they are driving.  steering just fails.  they said it was a fuse that overheats after idling for so long without warning.  if this is a component that fails that affects steering it needs to be fixed and changed.

"i would like to report another example of the tesla autopilot causing a near accident that could easily have claimed many lives.  here is a new thread on a tesla forum: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/scary-experience-with-ap2-0-autosteer-on-the-highway.89874/    the owner will almost certainly not be reporting this to nhtsa himself because tesla have assured him that all is well.  other forum posters are telling him that autopilot just needs more time to learn.  please act now before lives are lost due to this reckless experiment.    snip: hello,  i have a 60d with ap2- i tried using autosteer on the highway last monday (3 days after the update was released to my car), and had one of the worst/scariest experiences i've ever had while driving. i was driving on a major highway at ~75mph. turned on autosteer and was driving along (with my hands on the steering wheel) when i noticed it wasn't taking a left curve/turn on the road and drifting into the adjacent lane. so i engaged the steering wheel to deactivate autosteer and to make the turn myself. as soon as i did this, all hell broke loose. basically the steering wheel jerked all the way to the left, veering me inches from the barrier- and then as i tried to straighten the wheel it jerked me all the way to the right, across 3 lanes of traffic...and then back let to the barrier, back across traffic, and again 5 or 6 times.  of course i called tesla immediately and this is what i was told:  1) the car is not able to make that turn (a pretty mild curve) at 80mph- known issue with ap2.  2) the car functioned normally after that- any/all events following disengagement of the autosteer were due to ""driver input/error"""

"2016 silverado 3500 equipped with ""digital steering assist"" this is a known problem. at approximately 11,000 miles steering became extremely loose with about 3-4 inches of free play at the steering wheel.  took to 1st dealer, steering gear box was replaced according to chevrolet tsb and system worked as designed for approximately 3-4k miles. at that time steering again became loose but not as bad as the first time, about 1-2 inches of free play at the wheel with what feels like too much power steering, very light, dangerously light steering. vehicle taken to dealer 2, second repair attempt dealer stated system working as designed, at this time the digital steering assist worked as it should from 0 mph to 45 mph about 1-2 inches of free play at the wheel with what feels like too much power steering with very light steering from 46-74 mph, then works as designed from 75 mph on. i went for a test drive with the service manager, he stated ""i feel exactly what you are describing tight from 0-45 then light from 46-74 then tight from 75 on but the system is working as designed"". in spite of this they changed steering gear box again, 3rd part, with same result. works as it should from 0 mph to 45 mph about 1-2 inches of free play at the wheel with what feels like too much power steering, very light steering from 46-74 mph, then works as designed from 75 on. truck is used to pull 9.000 lbs enclosed trailer. pulling enclosed trailer at interstate speeds in winds is extremely dangerous and requires exhausting concentration and causes severe fatigue after only 150-200 miles. this is the very thing digital steering assist was supposed to eliminate. vehicle is dangerous to drive between the speeds of 45-75, and especially dangerous while accelerating or decelerating through the 44-46 mph range while turning due to sudden change in steering pressure from system such as  on/off ramps"

"my vehicle has acc (adaptive cruise control) and, when set, will accelerate and brake as needed to keep a certain distance from the vehicle in front that the system has identified via the radar and camera. i had an instance where there was a momentary loss of positive control of the vehicle under certain conditions. in this event, it was a hazy afternoon with wet roads. i was following a vehicle on a road with the acc set. the vehicle in front started a deceleration less than 10mph/s and my vehicle automatically started progressively increasing braking action to maintain separation. 1.5 - 2 seconds following; it appeared as though the abs kicked in and disconnected/overrode the acc witch subsequently stopped the braking action all together. as a result my vehicle proceeded torward the vehicle in front of me in a critical moment that required, now, even more braking action in conditions that initially caused the abs system to activate under normal braking action controlled by the acc. i was aware and had not let the semi autonomous features of my vehicle lull me into complacency. i reacted quickly and a collision had not occered. others may not be so quick to respond in a similar situation. i believe the system deactivated as a result of the abs shaking the brake pedal or control linkages, where, in normal operation depressing the brake disconnects the acc if the system starts an unwanted acceleration or the operator simply wanted to disconnect the system without toggling the steering wheel disconnect switch. this feature is available on all limited ultimate 2017 hyundai elantras."

"so far it has only done this under low speed making a tight turn like up to a gas pump or into a parking space the dash and display center will flash on and off and the steering wheel will jerk the other direction so violently it pulls the steering wheel out of your hand. also on the highway while driving about 20 mph i got a warning something to the effect that steering assist had been reduced drive with caution.  even under low speed it could have been dangerous but i'm afraid at some point this will occur at a higher speed. we bought the vehicle used, the factory warranty is gone but i have an extended warranty. i contacted my local chevy dealer because i considered a safety defect that should be taken care of beyond the warranty but they claim they know nothing about this as a problem despite the fact i have seen many complaints about this problem documented, that's what prompted me to file a complaint. the vehicle is currently at my mechanic hoping they can find a cause/solution but i think this is something gm/chevy should be doing a recall on and fixing instead of people having to pay out of pocket or private after market warranty companies having to pay for. i have a video of it doing it on my iphone but didn't know if i could include video and it's currently on my phone and not my laptop. i used 02/01/2017 as occurrence date but i'm not sure of that was the first time or not, we've had vehicle since 12/2016 and it's happened numerous times."
"i have an cadillac xt 5 2017. the lane departure warning does not work as advertised. i have spoke with several people from the dealer to dealers representative and regional manager. after 5 weeks the regional manager told me that the ldw was working properly as designed. he offered me some type of compensation ( $300 ). he agreed that i was correct that the way cadillac advertised this was incorrect and thank me for finding it. he said cadillac will be changing how they advertise this option.    well great what do i do with a $ 54,000 dollar i purchase that had false advertising.    i have had ldw in other gm vehicles and know how they work.    now to the problem, when i go over the line the seat is suppose to vibrate or hear a beep. i have tried to have either work but going over the line over 100 times it only worked 5 times. i was going over 40 miles per hour and the law was green but only alerted me those 5 times. also i was about 6 feet over the line each tine it went off those few times.  my concern is what happens if i nod off or fall asleep and drift over the line and i hit the car, curb, tree or telephone pole. i was also told that since i have lane keep assist that will keep my vehicle from going over the line. well i also tried that and the car does slightly pull me back in but if i pull to the right or left on over ride the lka where is my warning.  i can not be the only one who noticed this.  please help me  "

"my only complaint is the 'autosteer' feature. it's unclear why this is considered an option and it certainly does not function as described when i checked it off as a 5000.00 option under 'enhanced autopilot' when ordering my tesla. the system is dangerous, not ready for beta testing and certainly shouldn't be used on public roadways or with anyone you value in the car. i can see it being testing on closed roadways by skilled professional drivers but outside of that it is dangerous to engage at any speed. on surface streets it crosses over into oncoming traffic, drives like a drunk, is apt to pick up the left turn lanes, is confused by simple intersections, fails to see other cars cutting directly in front of it, attempts to follow parked cars, cannot stay in its own lane and fails to pick up pedestrians and motorcyclists.  at freeway speeds it slams on brakes for shadows, makes a decision to violently abort lane changes for no apparent reason and comes so close to sideswiping other cars that the other drivers frequently honk.    of course i keep my hands on the wheel and i'm a more vigilant driver while using this feature. i stopped using it with my 6 year old son in the car and i've now decided to stop using it even when i'm driving alone.  i gave it a chance to improve with time (over 3k miles on the car) and the recent updates and have taken it to the dealer twice but this has not improved the functioning. again, all of this is fine for testing on a closed track but the precious seconds spent correcting this feature and the dangerous situations it puts us in are a real hindrance to operating this vehicle safely.     i'm disappointed by this feature and i firmly believe this should be pulled from the fleet and reintroduced only when it's properly tested and safe. monies spent on this option should be refunded until it actually works.

this is a complaint about the power assisted steering in the tesla model s and it also applies to the model x.  there have been multiple reports on the tesla forums of owners having a failure pf the power assistance caused by a broken wire or loose connection.  tesla seems to be aware of the problem but is waiting for failures to occur rather than fixing the problem.  this failure is even more dangerous if the car is on autopilot.  the steering becomes extremely stiff and requires brute force.  if the user has just one hand loosely on the wheel as is often the case then it is easy to lose control completely.  here are links to threads discussing the problem and also clips of the relevant sections are attached as files.  please investigate.  https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/steering-assist-reduced.91280/  https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/steering-assist-reduced.78242/  https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/steering-assist-reduced.78242/page-2  
the adaptive cruise control slams on the brakes after just passing the end of a semi or large truck. it happens intermittently but has continued over the last 14 months. we have taken the vehicle to the dealer 4 times and they were unable to fix the problem.  we traded the vehicle in this last week it still has the same problem .
"my vehicle has had at least power steering assist failures since new. it was repaired under recall the last time it was worked on and performed as expected until my daughter was driving it home from work one evening and once again the steering went out. this happened while she was driving at between 55 and 60 mph, and could not steer the vehicle to get off the road. since then i have taken it to a dealer and talked to gm and pontiac about the issue. they all claim since it was repaired under recall and almost 2 years have passed since the repair was made that i am on my own. they refuse to help or make good on their repair claiming that they apparently are alright with a new part failing at about 24 months and about 50,000 miles as they state since the recall repair. given the history of the problem, i feel i am being unfairly ignored in my request for repairs to be made again under the recall since apparently the installed parts were defective."

"power steering assist failed suddenly while driving. when steering is out on these vehicles is actually almost impossible to turn the wheel. i have driven old vehicles without power steering and this is twice as hard to steer. this vehicle is equipped with the epas. apparently many people are having the same problem. i contacted ford and they dined coverage because the epas software was updated in 2015 as part of a recall for defective epas. the software update did not accomplish anything as the epas failed after the recall software update. this is a huge safety concern that needs to be address asap, i guess ford is waiting for fatal accidents to start occurring and increasing before they do something about this power steering defect."

i was driving down the highway at about 70 mph and the steering assistance malfunction message suddenly showed up on the display and the steering wheel became extremely tight to turn. restarting the car did not fix the issue.
"on two or three occasions after starting the car and shifting into drive, a warning light came on stating ""power steering assist failure"" and i could tell the car had no power steering.  each time i would shut the engine off, restart the vehicle, and the problem was rectified. on june 1, 2017, the same problem occurred but this time the power steering never returned.  i called a ford dealer and explained the problem and a service technician gave me a suggestion to disconnect and then connect the battery.  this did not help.  i brought the car into the dealership for repair and they found the whole steering assembly needed to be replaced costing in the neighborhood of $1750.  after reading numerous reports of the same problem on the internet i decided to file a complaint to ford and also to any consumer protection agencies."
this is another complaint about the tesla autopilot.  here is a video of an owner using autopilot hands free at high speed on a freeway and inches away from many oncoming cars on an undivided road.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=piqyoop5pyc  rather than keeping her hands on the wheel she instead gives the wheel a regular tweak every about once a minute but the remainder of the time her hands are nowhere near the wheel.  this is just one of many videos showing owners driving in dangerous ways.  i believe that these owners have been duped into having misplaced confidence in the autopilot and that the situation has been made worse by tesla using nhtsa apparent endorsement of the autopilot.    nhtsa has stated that tesla autopilot is 40% safer than a human driver based on the number of incidents which resulted in air-bag deployment according to data supplied by tesla.  the publication of this finding has caused owners to have high confidence in the autopilot.  might i politely ask - what is the sample size?  if the sample size was for example 100 air-bag deployments then that is a rather large number of crashes in proportion to the number of cars on the road.  it is also far too low a sample to provide statistically reliable results.    whenever a crash occurs tesla claims that the autopilot was not engaged at the  time.  this is probably true because the autopilot will disengage if the owner touches the wheel or the brake in the instant before impact.  at 3:20 in the video you can see the owner grab the wheel after the autopilot crosses double lines.  please take action to prevent further loss of life.

was driving on highway and the power steering assist fault notice came up and felt tight steering. pulled over and restarted with the same notice. had to keep driving with out power steering. it has now been out for 3 days. found out there was a recall for this on the 2011 ford fusion but my vehicle is not covered in this recall. why not. same issue as recall. i am very lucky i didn't crash. further research shows that there are thousands more like me. ford doesn't want to pay to have all vehicles with epas recalled. now they want to stick me with the bill whis is 1/4 of the value of the car. the vehicle was maufactured 07/10 and has only 37500 miles.
i've had my ford focus for 6 months. i've experienced recalls on the transmission which i have fixed. now my steering assist fault light is on and my power steering went out completely while turning into my driveway. this is a major issue. i have noticed that other people have the same issue and many people have been in horrible accidents. what if this was to happen to me and my children? it wouldn't just affect our lives but also our loved ones. i would love to know if there is a recall on this or there is an ability to get my money back on the car.
i start the vehicle in the parking lot and it immediately warns power steering assist fault. the steering wheel is extremely difficult to turn. i've never seen this before. i turned off the car and started it again and the steering appeared to work. very frightening drive home. looked up the issue online and found numerous complaints exactly like mine. also saw ford issued a recall for model years except 2010 for the same issue. i think this issue should be investigated and included in the same recall.
i was reversing out of my driveway when all of a sudden i lost control of the power steering and almost hit the wall at the end of my driveway! the power steering assist failure came on and has not gone off. i have tried restarting my vehicle many times to no avail.
"upon startup no power steering, making steering extremely difficult. dashboard message stating ""electronic steering assist fault needs service now"" diagnosis came back steering gear is bad. class action has been filed for 2012-14 ford focus as well as 2010-2014 ford fusion so it is a known issue but still no assistance by ford."

when i turn or go over bumps the car makes a loud squeeking/grinding noise. this started to occur after my power steering assist was replaced a month ago. several reviews also state this is a very expensive fix. my car only has 60k miles on it for a 2011. this is completely unacceptable!
power steering assist has problems. power steering locks up and car then can't be steered. happens sometime in the middle of driving it.  ford refuses to fix it. even though they know it has been a problem.  they even have class action lawsuites against them for it.
"july 2016 chose 2016 buick envision for forward collision alert automatic braking system - april 2017 got a letter from gm stating ""envision catalog inadvertently stated that forward collision alert automatically engages the vehicle brakes. it does not engage your brakes."" when we contacted the customer assistance center - four people later - we were told that gm was not prepared to add the feature we were lead to believe we had, which was the main reason we chose this vehicle in the first place. our gm customer case number is 299-450-8712 and the 4th person we spoke with was katrina at 1-866-790-5600 extension 5911824.

"when using the adaptive cruise control it maintains a user specified travelling distance behind the vehicle in front.  when the vehicle changes lanes, or is turning off, the vehicle is barely off the lane, but the adaptive cruise control still reacts to the car that has exited the lane.  this causes my toyota to react to the slowed vehicle that has just exited my lane by slowing unnecessarily, and causing vehicles behind me to have to slow and some times get irritated by this action.  i told toyota about this.  i was told there is a fix on the way, but no action has taken place in the past 3 years.  a tech drove the car on the road in front of the dealership, but he obviously did not drive the car enough, because if he had, he should have noticed this odd behavior.  it happens some on the interstate, but is more pronounced behavior when on 2 land roads.  this behavior has occurred ever since we bought it new."
"my car had absolutely no warning signs of any steering issues. i drove to the tanning bed with no problem and when i came out and started my car the ""service alert"" came up saying ""steering assist fault service required."" my car had been stationary for maybe 20 minutes. i tried backing out of my parking spot and it was extremely difficult to turn the wheel. i was able to drive home- my arms were very sore by the time i pulled in the driveway. i called ford this morning to inquire about this issue and was advised it sounds like a leak in my steering system but the car is safe to drive. my biggest concern, aside from how much this is going to cost me, is that they said it was safe to drive?! if someone or something were to pull out in front of me or i needed to swerve out of the way for any reason it would literally be impossible to do so."

"the car had few recalls and few warranties issues since i purchase the car.  for the specific, right now, my car has a ""power steering assist fault ""  ford issued a recall for the model fusion year 2011 related to this problem, that is a major safety problem because the steering wheel will lock in place. fortunately mine locked when i start the car.   i had aaa towed my car to my mechanic, and then from there to the ford dealer because they couldn't help my mechanic with information unless the car was at their location for a diagnosis ( that i need to pay for it), a diagnosis that my mechanic did for free.    now, the recall that ford has in place do not include my vehicle, they said that the vin number is not included in the recall, and that is nothing they can do about it:    so we are looking at the same model, same year, same specific problem.... but they refuse to extend the recall to mine!     the repair, which btw, is not a part of a vehicle that needs to be repaired, replace or maintain in the lifetime of the vehicle, will cost over $3,000.......  i cannot repair the car.    ford cs, suggest me to repair the car,  telling me to save the receipt in case ford decide to extend the recall.    additionally, i was offered 10% discount.... wow    i am a single mom, have a special need son, lost my long time ( 17 1/2 years) job, and work only part time ... i am desperate!     i need to have the car working, i cannot afford to pay that much money and i think that this is insane !!   the dealer and the ford cs told me that they cannot share their findings with the customer, but only the decision, which is to not include the vehicle in the recall.

"was making a right turn from a state road to a city street the dash display popped up stating there was a power steering assist fault and i lost my power steering immediately. i was able to forcefully turn the steering wheel to avoid going into oncoming traffic. don't believe my wife would have had the same results. took vehicle to ford dealership to be looked at. $1600.00 later to replace the rack and pinion steering unit which includes the power steering assist mechanism. i was lucky to not get into a crash. after reading about other people having the same issue which did result in a crash, i feel ford needs to put this on re call notice before a death occurs."
electronic power steering assist gear intermittently fails causing the steering on the vehicle to be incredibly difficult to steer at low speeds. when the power steering assist fails at intersections this car becomes sluggish in steering response. i fear this will result in an accident. this ford fusion only has 120k miles. this vehicle falls outside the ford power steering assist gear recall range and the ford customer satisfaction program representative (ryan) stated this particular vin is not covered under the recall and stated they are not responsible.
2016 ford escape with 5770 miles. started car and had steering assist fault. no power steering. had to be towed to dealer. they replaced the steering unit due to a steering control unit failure. if it would have happened while driving i probably would have been involved in an accident as it was near impossible to turn the steering wheel. repair covered by warranty. vehicle was stationary at the time of failure.
"electronic gremlins periodically hit.   -at random times the front or rear sensors don't ""see"" objects. i have kissed bumpers with another car when neither of us saw the other, and my genesis failed to see. it's allowed me on at least two occasions to pull too close to objects in front.  -worse, there are random episodes where the adaptive cruise control fails to see traffic in front of it. numerous times we have narrowly missed collisions when we had to quickly and forcefully apply brakes. i've experienced this as has my wife and more importantly clients!  -the self-retracting mirrors frequently to not work properly and we have to manually override.

"i received a recall letter from mercedes benz regarding the safety of my vehicles power steering which could go out at any time, changing from automatic to manual control. the letter stated ""the power steering assist may deactivate, increasing the risk of a crash."" i called mercedes benz usa and was told they could not guarantee 100 % that the car was safe to drive. they stated they have no parts to fix problem and would send another letter as parts become available. i explained i do mountain driving weekly which includes changing weather conditions thru out the year, therefore this response is not acceptable. i was told it was up to me if i chose to park the car and not drive it until they have parts  (in a month or so). the gentleman told me they don't  even know what the exact problem is. mercedes benz usa does not offer any help for this situation."
"while driving thru a parking lot i received a warning ""service advantrac"" then while making a turn into a food drive thru another alarm went off. power steering assist fault. i lost all power steering and nearly crashed into the drive thru sign. this all happened within minutes. when the steering goes out there is not advanced indications or warnings until it happens. the electric assist motor is just disabled. you have no steering at that point. it is harder to turn then an older manual steering vehicle.   the entire rack n pinion steering unit has to be replaced due to under engineering. it is one motor but is embedded into the rack. the cost alone is 1200.00 for the rack not including labor to install and reprogram.   to me this is an extreme safety issue that will some day get someone severely injured or death due to a non steering vehicle. at the time of the failure i had just driven over a very steep and windy mountain road. scary to think what might have happened if it had failed on that road."

steering column makes a rubbing noise when turning at slow speeds (<5 mph). sound is less at higher speeds. ford dealer says to replace steering unit due to possible power steering assist failure ($1600) and a power steering assist fail could result in loss of steering and a crash. this sounds like it should fall under the power steering assist recall for the 2011+ fusions.

there is loss of power steering assist when traveling at low speeds. it is unsafe as the vehicle becomes hard to steer when turning left or right. this issue is known to the auto-maker and they only want to replace power steering pump and fluid. the power steering gear is leaking and gm should recall this unsafe part. the steering function of an automobile is critical as human lives are at the mercy of this component of the vehicle to operate as designed.

"starting in 2013 we had various sudden power steering assist faults; occurring at speeds less than 40 mph, one frightening episode was with my 10th grade daughter with her permit, while she was having driving lesson with me, we made it to the side in traffic; she did not have the strength to turn the wheel when p/s was gone. after at least a dozen  occurrences (restarting did resolve the issues), in early 2015  i took it to the ford dealer for some answers, i separately had the codes checked at an  autozone type place,the only code that came up was an evaporative purge valve code; nothing about the p/s fault.i did not tell ford about the codes. ford called to tell me i needed  to have the computer replaced for $1500. but they could not id a mechanical p/s fault, nor purge valve code.asked what was wrong with computer.no failure mode was given.pay $1500 for a repair that you cannot identify? they""reset"" the comp. the problem  not repeated until just 7/17/17 but restart now does not clear it or lifting batt leads.my husband  able to drive it home but with difficulty. this event the car was  less than 25 mph, made right turn from stop,then lost p/s. oil change warning light is on too. needs oil & inspection but in driveway,may not pass inspection. ford claims in the 2010 handbook  the car is still drivable when p/s is lost! did ford get that cleared with state inspectors when they knew they had this problem. i am in my mid-fifties and active but have a muscle weakening condition. i don't know if i would have the strength either to get this car to the side for safety. it boggles my mind that the 2010 my has not been placed on recall but 2012 through 2014(?) have. please take every action to place this item on a recall path. thank you."
"on 4th, june, 2017, i was driving this 2-month-old tesla model x. while i was making a turn at one of the downward passage in a carpark, the steering wheel could not move all of a sudden, and a warning popped up saying car need service/steering assist reduced. then a while later the steering wheel could move again allow me to finish the turn, but then stopped working again leaving me stuck in the car park.     their technician replied that this had happened to a number of model x cars but only while parked and not during driving.    after inspection, the technician replied that the power wire for the assist steering wheel has had bad electrical contact. this was due to a loosen screw which fix the position of that power wire. the cause could be that the screw is not tight before delivery, or due to vibration when driving on the road. then they told us the screw is now tightened and the car is ready for pickup.    i think this is a very serious life-threatening problem. imagine if you drive on a highway and the wheel suddenly stop when you make a turn!     we told them that this car model is unsafe and could cause danger to the general public, what if this problem cause any accident. they only replied the car is under warranty. and they offer no refund, no exchange    moreover, given this is a new car, there should be not any wear out problem. however, there was a metal bar under the car seat which was rusted (file in a separate complain). their technician replied that it is due to the humidity. could that happen to other metal parts of the car, such as screw?    according to other car technicians, other vehicles do not have such weakness (requiring a screw for powering the steering wheel). could that be a design problem?    note: although this car is purchase outside of the america, the same model car in the u.s. may have the same safety problem. i am just notifying."
"my wife was driving the car (in motion on a freeway exit).  power steering went out and the following two codes popped up, ""service advance trax' and 'power steering assist fault'. looks like an expensive fix. based on the number people having the same problem, ford should do something to service this dangerous problem. it looks like a manufacturing problem."

my daughter was driving her new/used ford focus into town and the epas--power steering assist fault coded and she had no power steering.  she was going roughly 55 and she could notice it becoming harder to steer.  by the time she made it so a parking lot for safety it was close to non-steerable.  it became hard for her to steer and luckily she did not have or cause and accident with the sudden change.  she tried to assess what was wrong which is when we learned there is no powersteering fluid as it has and eletric steering assist instead.  it doesn't work now and shortly after this code faulted the entire car shut down.  it won't start and is useless--ford replaced a perfectly good steering system with crap.  i hope nobody gets hurt be this defective system.

"2014 ford focus power steering issue  while driving this vehicle the power steering failed while making a right turn on a busy roadway in a urban area. the steering wheel locked in the turning position and the  power steering assist warning light came on. i had to put the vehicle in park and turn the ignition off. i turned the ignition back on and put the vehicle in drive and the vehicle's power steering failed once more and the steering wheel locked a second time. i once again put the vehicle in park and turned off the ignition and removed the key. i waited several seconds and started the ignition, placed the vehicle in drive and the vehicle once again failed. i had the car taken to the dealership for servicing and was told that this is a common issue this vehicle has and it would take several weeks to repair due to the volume of repairs this dealership has at the moment. i had this same vehicle repaired several months ago for the transmission issue that is currently under recall. the car performed fairly well after the repair. the same hesitation issue began again a few weeks ago and now this issue arose as well. i asked the dealer if this too would be covered under the recall / warranty and was told the transmission was but they did not know if the power steering issue was but would get me an answer from ford. i've read all the other complaints regarding this vehicles issues and my experience is the exact same. there's no doubt in my mind that ford is well aware of this issue judging on how many formal complaints have been issued. i will be letting go of this vehicle when it is repaired. i will not operate this 2014 ford focus in good conscience knowing full well that it presents a significant liability to my safety and the safety of others."

"on july 26, 2017 i experienced a near total loss of steering of my 2015 ford fusion while driving in a parking garage. warning lights indicating a loss of power steering assist and of traction control activated. steering returned to normal after restarting the vehicle. my ford dealership was contacted. i tried to then drive to the dealership for repair when the problem repeated itself. i got safely to the side of the road and arranged for a tow. the problem was diagnosed as being a failed steering gear assembly and the power steering rack was replaced, costing $1,871.42.  a brief internet search indicates there have been at least three recalls of fusions (and other ford / lincoln models) for power steering assist failure (6/11/2013; 5/2/2015; 6/27/2015). this is apparently a common problem with fusions and  reports of symptoms identical to those described herein are numerous.  the actual failure that caused this event is unknown: codes were pulled that indicated the electric steering rack assembly needed replacement but this does not pinpoint what part of the assembly was at fault.  when asked what would cause this loss of steering on a vehicle having 59,666 miles on it, the ford service manager suggested it was due to ""driving over rough roads"".   this explanation, whether true or not, is absurd and unacceptable. the vehicle is operated under the same road conditions common to all drivers. if the design and manufacture of the fusion steering system is delicate enough to fail under normal use it should be replaced.  problems that result in compromised steering or braking are life-threatening. it would seem to be only a matter of time before the ongoing steering problems with the fusion results in death."
"on july 20, 2017, while pulling the vehicle out of my garage, the power steering failed. a warning light about traction control came on. thinking the traction control had inadvertently been pressed, i turned the vehicle off and then on again. the vehicle began functioning normally at that point.  on sunday, july 30, 2017, as my husband was driving on the highway, with me and 3 of our children as passengers, the power steering failed again and warning lights came on simultaneously about traction control being turned off and power steering assist needing service. the steering wheel was extremely difficult to move. turning the vehicle off and then on once again seemed to reset the power steering again. i called autofair ford of haverhill, ma  the next day and they told me to bring the vehicle in that afternoon.  on the way to autofair ford, the power steering failed again. autofair diagnosed the issue as a failed steering rack and replaced the steering rack and program system for a total of $1721.90.  upon researching this issue online, i learned that the 2011, 2012, and 2013 ford explorers had the same or very similar issue and there was a recall.  in addition, i found message threads on various websites of 2014 ford explorers having the same or similar issues as we did. luckily, when the power steering failed on my vehicle, we were able to keep the vehicle under control and an accident did not occur; however, if sudden sharp steering would have been needed, there likely would have been one. in addition, a failure such as this one should not occur on a vehicle that is barely 3 years old with about 48,450 miles on it. we have had all regular recommended maintenances performed on this vehicle at autofair ford, formally regan ford, from the time of purchase as a new vehicle."
"i was driving in my 2012 ford fusion, on a highway in new york state and pulled over at a rest area for a snack.  upon returning to the vehicle, i started the car and was given a ""power steering assist fault"" error message and i had no power steering.  there was no way i could have driven the car and i'm thankful this didn't happen a few minutes earlier when i was driving on the highway in traffic, in the rain.  ford has had a recall for this same issue, but my car is not listed and now it will cost us $1,800 to have this common problem fixed by replacing the computer that handles the power steering.  the mechanic at the ford dealer laughed it off saying he sees it all the time.  the computer goes if you turn hard or hit a bump.  ford needs to open up this recall and cover the replacement of this system."
"the car gets an alarm and power steering stops working. the car is very difficult to turn at slow speeds and is a work out at road speeds depending on degree of turn. there are two alarms present. ""steering assist fault service required"" and ""service advancetrac. there was an alarm that happened twice (at around 55,000 miles & 62,000 miles) before with the same effort needed in steering but it went away when the car was shut off and restarted. if this had happened in the middle of a sharp turn there would have been an accident as it takes a lot of effort to turn the wheel"
i received a power steering assist failure on the dash readout while backing up in a parking structure.  steering locked up and could not turn steering wheel or change directions. i was able to reset it by turning off and on the ignition.  luckily this didn't happen while driving. two days later i was able to get the vehicle to ford service center. ford dealership later diagnosed this to rack and pinion needing replacement at $1700 parts and labor.  they claimed they could get the fault to reoccur while monitoring the computer port.  seem like a safety issue to me.  car is a 2010 and has 118k miles.  the service manager and workers were very concerned that we drove the car tot he dealership.  they know of these issues and refuse to acknowledge any assistance to the consumer with warranty or recall.  i guess we need a few more dead humans before they take notice.

"when driving and you make slight turns and go back to straighten wheel out the steering locks up for a few seconds. from all the research i have done it seems like the electronic power steering assist is the issue. i noticed this to happen as we were driving through the mountains. i see online others having the same issue. it is very dangerous. the wheel  gets very hard to hold onto and i would hate to have to be in a big turn and can't turn the wheel back especially if we are going at a normal speed. this will act up at anytime on any type of road.  from research this can be quiet expensive for the repair, as it is causing other things to be affected that may need repairs as well."

this is a complaint about the tesla autopilot.  this video has just been uploaded:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvokisddxyw    in this video a tesla employee is demonstrating the autopilot to the passengers.  she drives on undivided roads just inches from oncoming traffic with her hands completely off the wheel.  she encourages the passengers to believe that this is safe and that it is only necessary to squeeze the wheel occasionally to keep the autopilot happy.  lives are being placed at at risk by the irresponsible marketing of this glitchy and unsafe contraption.  thank you.  concerned citizen.  
"power steering assist fault came on right after starting vehicle. was unable to move the steering wheel.  kept shutting car down and restarting but to no avail. the previous day while on the freeway in commuter traffic day the ongoing transmission problem that 2 different local ford service centers worked on 3 separate occasions. the 1st time i was told they replaced the transmission. the following times they replace a competent and re-programed it. as soon as i left the service center i could tell nothing was done. i called the service rep back and he said it was ""adaptive"" and i needed to allow it time to adapt. i was told i had a cracked motor mount. i told him it had to be caused by the violent jerking of the transmission when accelerating regardless of the circumstances. in stop and go city traffic i have been close several times to being rear ended because of its jerking /hesitation/acceleration. tow truck driver could not move the wheel. vehicle finally towed to local dealer. my extended warranty has been covering the transmission repairs but was told the safety problem on the steering was not covered under the warranty. i'm told to fork over 2k + to fix the steering before they would attempt servicing the transmission. ford knows they have problems with steering and transmission but fail to correct them. the steering has been documented about going out on drivers at high rate of speeds on the freeway. ford is intentionally risking the lives of focus owners and passengers.  this is a serious safety issue that ford needs to correct now by immediate recall. it's obvious they gave no idea how to correct the transmission problem."
"2010 ford fusion 2.0l sle originally experienced intermittent power steering assist fault.  the fault was able to be cleared by restarting the vehicle and would remain dormant for a number of days or weeks.  recently, my wife attempted to drive the car and the psaf fault reappeared and is now unable to be reset by restarting the vehicle.  the fault occurs during every vehicle start cycle.  i have attempted to move the vehicle and run the steering wheel through its entire range of motion to induce a sensor or encoder reset with no success.  it now appears that i will need to contact a dealer to resolve the problem.    apparently this a known problem that has been addressed in fusions produced after 2010.  what are my options to resolve this problem?  the vehicle cannot be operated in its current condition."

"bentley lane assist  - major issue  the bentley lane assist is supposed to keep you in a lane, however twice now i have been travelling on a two way road and it has taken me with a violent steering manoeuvre into oncoming traffic.    the issue is that when you are in a two lane road and the road markings in the centre line spread apart for a left turn area, the car will often follow the outside line instead of the inside line, that line taking you into oncoming traffic.    you then need to violently yank the steering to correct he lane assist.    i took the vehicle immediately to bentley after the second occasion and they failed again to find the fault.  they asked me if i could video it happening - but that seems to make a dangerous situation more dangerous and i don't know when it is going to happen. this is the problem with self driving cars that are designed badly, it makes you incredibly nervous to drive as you never know what the car is going to do.

"bentley dynamic cruise control - dangerous     the car has dynamic cruise control that is very dangerous in certain settings.  it is possible to shorten the distance to the next car on a highway to approximately 100 yards, and the car will continue at the cruise if there is no car in front.  then on the highway when traffic is stopped or slow the car will drive at say 65 mph directly toward the stopped vehicles because the setting is set at 100 yards.  the radar has the ability to see 300-400 yards, but in the shortened setting instead of looking out at 300-400 yards it disregards that input taking only the 100 yard input.    what then happens is the car on realising that the stationary object is now at 100 yards attempts to do an emergency stop. which is impossible.    this happened by accident to me on a highway, and i have to swerve onto the hard shoulder to avoid a collision.    if the manufacturer wants to install intelligent systems then it would be really helpful if they were designed right.  it is absolutely possible to take a radar input at 300 yards and 100 yards from the system and then manage this situation safely.    this is a basic design fault.  they should go test a mercedes to see how to design this properly."
vehicle became very difficult to steer while driving in the city.   power steering assist fault code indicated on console.     recall available on ford fusion 2011 - 2014.   why was 2010 excluded.

"smart cruise control fails to brake intermittently. it is designed to match speed with the car in front of it. it usually works fine, unless another vehicle cuts in front, even if there is enough time to brake. i have to slam on the brakes manually to avoid an accident. this has happened on multiple occasions. i now fear using the cruise control at all, as it does not perform correctly 100% of the time. the dealer said they could find nothing wrong, but this is a very real issue that puts my family at risk. they have now called in a master tech from hyundai to look at it, but i wanted to document this issue.  i noticed it first within two weeks of purchase. hyundai support closed my case several times without action. i bought it 5 months ago. current mileage is 3462, so it is well within warranty."

"whilst in motion and on a city street, i could no longer control the steering wheel of my vehicle. it resisted my control like it had a mind of its own, and i had to use extreme force to get it to turn where i wanted it to and pull over. seemed to drift even when going straight. warning light then appeared on screen that said something like ""steering assist malfunction"". this malfunction can occur at any moment, and nothing in particular seemed to trigger it. upon further research, it seems this is a problem many people have had with power steering and has put many in danger."

"i started my car in the driveway and i was alerted to the message ""steering assist fault, service required"" and i was unable to steer my car out of the driveway, it was very hard to move the steering wheel, totally unsafe to drive. my car is out of warranty now. i'll have to pay a hefty $1000-$2000 for this repair. ford should definitely recall the steering issue in the ford focus as there has been hundreds of complaints. it is so unfair to have customers pay this out of pocket when clearly it is a manufacturing defect and not at all caused by the actions of the driver. my 2012 ford focus has given me problem after problem in the 2 years i have had it. so frustrated and unhappy with this car."

"this has happened several times at freeway speeds on freeways. this issue occurs when using adaptive cruise control if the vehicle encounters a panic stop situation and determines it is unable to autonomously stop in time. when the collision warning activates and the driver uses the brakes, the adaptive cruise control disengages the autonomous braking and braking is reduced until the brake pedal travels a significant amount. this increases the stopping distance and may cause an accident. the behavior of the adaptive cruise control should be changed so that a driver applying the brakes disengages adaptive cruise control acceleration (if active) but does not disengage adaptive cruise control braking (if active). i had a 2005 jaguar with adaptive cruise control and it did not exhibit this behavior."

"driving down any road with tar strips sometimes causes the vehicle to give a warning (wheel shake) of lane departure. this is easily overridden by the driver, but is very irritating.  it must think the tar strips are lane markers!  when the cruise control (adaptive cruise control) is engaged, the acc can sometimes jam on the brakes with no obstacle in the path.  it happens when cars ahead are pulling off to the left or right but are clearly out of the lane of travel.  this happened on a two lane undivided suburban road.  i have had two near misses with following cars having to brake, and two other times with no cars following.  one event happened on a curve of a two lane divided road with a car completely in the left hand turn lane ahead with my vehicle in the lane of travel.  acc jammed my brakes on causing me to have to hit the brake pedal and then accelerator to avoid cars behind. there is no defeat for the acc function so just regular cruise control can be used.  this cruise control is not ready for prime time!  honda just says their is nothing wrong with it and the software is up to date.  it is so scary i'm considering trading this vehicle for one that won't get me into an accident. the subaru eyesight system is remarkably better than this disaster."

"when i bought the car in september, 2015, within the first week i first saw the ""steering assist fault - service required"" message when i started my car. turning the car off, then back on again, removed the message, and power steering worked fine. i would get this message once or twice a month, only when starting the car, and never while driving. turning the car off then on again always resolved the issue. i mentioned it to the dealer when i brought it in for its first oil change. they said they didn't have the staff available on the weekend to fix it, that i'd need to make an appointment during the week to have it looked at. but the fact that it was only happening occasionally, it was driving ok and the issue was resolved when restarting the car, i was told it wasn't urgent and the next time i brought it in for service they would look at it. so in january, 2016, when i brought it in for service and i mentioned the issue, they looked for the error code but couldn't see it, so there was nothing to fix. i kept getting the steering assist fault message about once or twice a month, only when starting the car, and it would resolve when restarting the car. in august 2017 i brought my car to firestone for inspection, and i mentioned it then. they looked for the message but could not see the error code, so there was nothing to fix. 2 weeks later, september 2017, i started the car, got the message, turned the car off and on, and got the message again. i tried restarting my car 6-7 times, still no power steering. i drove a little, stopped, turned it off and on again, still no power steering. the dealer says it needs the steering gear replaced, and will cost $1700.00."
"while driving my 2014 chevy silverado  around 42000 miles i stopped at a  light on a highway and lost all electrical power and the service steering assist came on dash. i was able to restart the truck and go. it happened multiple times. while driving it around a bend on a highway the truck shut off i lost all steering the steering locked up and i almost crashed, the service assist light came on again. this happened multiple times when turning. on 4-13-17 i brought the truck to a chevy dealer it was was still under warranty. they could not reproduce the problem. 8-24-17 i brought the truck in for a recall #17276 for reprogramming the power steering assist control modular. after the recall the truck started doing it more often the same day but the steering did not lock up but the truck shut off when i tried making a turn on a highway. the service steering assist light came on again. on 9-7-17 i brought the truck back to the chevy dealer ( chevy dealer now changed its name from oasis to quality ) complaining that the recall did not work. they said that the recall was not for that. but i believe it is the same problem. they chevy dealer drove the truck for 10 miles and it happened to them.they charged me for the time to trouble shoot the problem and found a loose ground wire #g218 under the dash causing the problem. i have driving the truck for 2 days now and it seems fine. the issue is that they made me pay for something they should have fixed the first time and i believe that this should have been part of recall # 17276, because i believe part of recall #17276 had to do with low voltage to the steering modular. a loose ground will give you low voltage. any way this is very dangerous and i have read online of others having the same problem. please make a recall about this loose ground wire that makes the truck shut off and lose steering before someone dies. thank you"
"on july 13, 2017 my sister and i were on vacation and i pulled in to fill up with gas.  got the gas, started the car and a message came up steering assist malfunction -see technician. tried to drive the the car and it would not steer. no previous warning at all.  car was steering great until then.  had to have it towed. was in a small town in pa. without a ford dealer. nearest ford dealer was half hr away and couldn't look at it for several days.  we were 5 1/2 hrs from our home.  had to call my son and brother to come and tow us home. it scares me to death to think what would have happened had i been driving on the highway.  took it to my dealer and they said it was the steering rack and module assembly. wanted to charge me $2300.00 but i complained and they finally charged me $1900.00.  called ford but got no where with them.  said it was a customer bill.  does someone have to die before ford recalls this problem."
"on several occasions while driving with the cruise control engaged, as i approach a vehicle from the rear that is going slower, the automatic braking system engages and displays a message similar to this! "" shut down engine immediately, service required.""    the first time it happened, i did so, and had the car towed to a dealership.  they said they could not find anything wrong.  i've reported this problem to the dealership that regularly services the car, and they say they can't recreate the condition. it appears to be a software problem.  on several occasions recently when this condition appears, the ability to resume acceleration is lost momentarily, and the car slows down drastically.  it suddenly relents, and resumes travelling at the preset speed.  this always happens on major highways where cruise control is engaged.  i'm very concerned that one day the warning may lead to a catasrophic failure of the engine"
"on 8/22/17 i brought my ridgeline to apple  honda in riverhead ny due several warning lights being activated.  the activated warning lights are as follows: collision mitigation, road departure mitigation, blind spot info system, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, power steering system, vehicle stability assist, hill start assist, trailer stability assist. after a query of your database i found that similar problems have been reported and as a result of this the following nhtsa campaign number 16v888000 was generated.  my concern is apple honda is under reporting and or not report these incident as required.  in my situation i was told my problem was a direct result of a missing fuse c-28.  when researched this fuse is referenced to option.   my problem lays at the missing fuse. fuses just dont go missing. and as per my conversation with the honda service rep alex costa tag # 765 if this fuse was missing the vehicle wouldn't operate. again my primary concern is the mislabling of this recall as a missing fuse."
vehicle has 40k miles.  began displaying stabilitrak probkem at 30k miles along with warning that steering assist is diminished.  this seems to be the same problem with their 2015 models.

"the adaptive cruise control system is defective and dangerous.  slams on the brakes when approaching vehicles inside considered safety zones.  slows vehicle from 75-80mph on the freeway to less than 60mph.  vehicles behind forced to brake to avoid collision.  changing lanes the vehicle failed to resume highway speeds in a acceptable manner potentially causing vehicles in that lane to brake to avoid collision.  in traffic the system is so jerky it can't be used. the system also fails to recognize an open lane and resume speed.  the system also responds to vehicles to the driver's side lane and slows down and won't resume speed. in left or right turns on the freeway at freeway speeds the system reacts to vehicles across lanes and slows the vehicle to less than a safe operating speed causing a potential danger to not only the car we are in but to cars following behind .  the collision avoidance system also malfunctions by the ""brake"" warning light comping on for seemingly no reason."
"while driving on the freeway at freeway speeds warning light started flashing stating, ""power steering assist fault"" and ""service advancetrac"" i then immediately lost power steering and luckily was going straight so muscling the steering wasn't overly difficult.  got off the freeway and restarted the car and the power steering returned.  5 days later while driving slowly the same thing happened but now restarting the car doesn't get the problem to go away.  power steering isn't working on the car at all.  when i start the car the info screen reads: power steering assist faults appears.  it is extremely difficult to turn the wheel, then an alarm sounds and the indicator light for service advancetrac appears and steering gets slightly easier but power steering is still not functioning. very difficult and dangerous to drive the car now but i have to get to work and don't have the money to get it fixed."

"while driving at 60 miles an hour on a 4 lane highway, i was going around a slight curve when the lane assist came on.  i was in the left lane and not near the left line in road, but centered in the middle of lane.  i heard one beep and then the steering wheel became very loose in my hand and it took me a few seconds to gain control of the steering wheel.  this also happened while going on a slightly curved city street going about 40 miles an hour.   it scared the dickens out of me as it was not what i expected the lane assist to do.   i went back to dealership and told them about the steering and they said i just needed to get used to how the electric steering worked.  after it happened a couple more time i made appointment for someone to take a test drive.  the technician felt a slight swaying but said it was the type of steering of the lane assist.  he suggested i turn it off and not use it for a while and see how car then handled.  the technician filed case # 26296330423, no problem found with vehicle, system is operating as designed, no repair attempt performed.  (eqmr was also filled out and submitted.)  i have not driven my forester with the assist on since this happened.  i have not had this loose wheel steering happen again.  i am convinced it is the lane assist and feel it is not working properly in my vehicle.  i will probably never use it again.  lane departure is fine, does what it's supposed to do.  i have no complaints with the dealership or their technician, they were very thorough and kind.  this lane assist is just an aspect of this safety technology that i don not like how it works.  or is there something wrong with it in my car that this has not happened to others yet?    i do understand how lane assist works, i did test drives having it on and it would bring me back to my lane if i went over the line without a blinker on."
"while driving at any speed on any type of surface, trying to maintain a straight direction, the steering wheel makes small jerks in one direction, then releases just as you have compensated for the initial jerk causing you to move abruptly to the other direction.  this continues causing you to make ongoing small corrections and your overall path to zig-zag.  this alone has nearly caused me to collide with oncoming traffic while driving on narrow roads.  occasionally, the power steering assist stops working entirely, requiring additional effort to steer the vehicle.  there are recalls for this exact problem (torque sensor assembly) in the same make/model/year just not for my particular vehicle (gm tells me, my vehicle's manufactured date does not fall into the recall, even though it is the same exact problem)."
"i have a 2015 gmc canyon with 54700 miles on it.  on occasion, while driving, the vehicle beeps and displays a message ""steering malfunction ..."" at which point the steering assist stops working.  the vehicle can still be steered but it takes both hands and a lot of effort to turn the wheels, especially at slow speeds. problem appears to happen mostly when driving on straight or gentle curved roads.    shutting off the engine and letting the system ""rest"" for 5+ minutes allows the power assist steer to reset and start working again, until the next failure.    recently had the dealer reinstall the steering software to see if that had any impact.  worked good for a few days but the issue returned after several days."

"while driving my 2017 dodge durango citadel (6980 miles) home from work, i had the adaptive cruise control set. i was in a steady line of traffic and cars lined up behind me. the truck started to steadily decrease in speed, there were no objects in the path of the vehicle and the car in front was at least 6 car lengths ahead. when i tried to accelerate the vehicle nothing happened when i tried to accelerate, i then attempted to brake, my brakes were not active as well. i placed my hazard lights on and attempted to turn the steering wheel slightly to move my vehicle from the road. however, at this time my steering had tightened and i could not move my vehicle. i ended up coasting to the right side of the road until my vehicle came to a stop. nothing was working on my truck. i could not open my door or let my windows down. it was like i was trapped inside. finally, i was able to get my windows down after 3 or more minutes. when the towing service picked my vehicle up, the back windows would not roll up and my lift gate opened by itself. we got the lift gate back down manually. however, the vehicle would not start. if you placed your foot on the brake, pushed the start button it just made a clicking noise. the vehicle is currently at the dealership and will be looked at tomorrow, 9/26/17. this could have been a horrible, fatal accident. some type of investigation needs to take place into this matter. my son and i travel many miles a week and this would have definitely been fatal if we were on the interstate on an inside lane."
"a fault in the electric power steering (eps) system resulted in an immediate loss of power steering assist without warning to the driver. this unexpectedly increased the steering effort force necessary to steer the vehicle at lower vehicle speeds, which increased the risk of a crash causing injury and/or damage to property."

"sudden loss of power steering assist even after the recall reprogramming.    we previously took the vehicle in for recall number 14s05 in aug. 2014.  trouble codes were not found at that time so the dealer only did a reprogramming which was designed to prevent the loss of power assist and alert the driver with a warning light and chime if it did occur.      our vehicle had a complete loss of power steering assist while driving on 9/24/17 but there were no driver alerts. we had the vehicle towed to a ford dealer and they found trouble code b1342 which if found during our 2014 recall appointment would have resulted in the steering column being replaced.  we were told by the dealer that the steering column needs to be replaced but that our vehicle was no longer eligible for the recall due to the previous reprogramming, even thought it was completely ineffective in resolving the critical safety issue or alerting the driver.   had we never taken the vehicle to the dealer for the reprogramming, we would still be eligible for the warranty replacement of the steering column.    clearly, our vehicle experienced the exact power steering loss and failure code that was related to the recall.  the reprogramming did not have the intended result whatsoever - we still experienced the power steering loss, there was no warning light/message and there was no chime to alert the driver of the loss.    i have tried to escalate this issue within ford customer service but they are denying any responsibility to resolve this known defect under the recall warranty due to the previous reprogramming.  i'm hoping nhtsa can help resolve this critical safety issue - i'm sure we're not the only ones affected!"

"when i started the engine i got a power steering assist fault warning on my dash and had no power steering.  had it towed to my mechanic, he told wiring had been chewed by a rodent.  he repaired the wiring but it still wouldn't work.  had it towed to dealer and steering unit was replaced about $2000.  three weeks later same    warning when i went to start it.  towed to dealer again, told faulty part, would be replaced under warranty, no charge.  went down to look at car and asked about pro-actively using rodent tape before installing new part as a precaution to prevent any future problems.  was shown that there wasn't any visible damage.  called me the next day to tell me there was rodent damage to wiring harness that they hadn't seen, that they had cut open the wiring cover and found the wires chewed. my question as to how they knew to cut open the shroud to find the chewed wires in the shroud was answered that there was a ""pin-hole"" ""tooth-hole"" in the shroud, but 3 of the 4 wires were separated. . they could try to fix wiring for about $400.00.  spoke to service manager and he agreed to repair it and absorb the $400, as it was about 3 hours labor and would only ""cost"" the dealer about $60.00.  next day he called to say they repaired the wiring but still didn't work, so they would have to replace the part and it would cost me another $1,997.80.  this was friday and i said i'd call him on monday.  i think it is absurd that a consumer is forced into a $2000 repair for a wire, and believe there is a faulty design which would render a $2000 part useless when a wire is cut."

"power steering assist failure indicated on instrument panel and full loss of any steering assist. steering requires/required lots of muscle to maintain any form of active driver intended steering changes. it may fail at highway speeds of 70 or on vehicle startup. fortunately, we were able to maintain control of the vehicle and find a safe place to stop and fortunately reset the power assist without anyone being injured or killed. restarting vehicle reset the ps assist module for a few months but the system is now fully nonworking. the steering goes out whenever it desires.   the vehicle is currently in the shop with a possible rack-and-pinion replacement or a steering column replacement once the problem is fully diagnosed. this will also require a vehicle alignment and possible computer reset and re-flash according to the shop. cost will be at least $2500.   thanks ford for doing the right thing for your corporate structure and offloading your responsibility and cost for your poor engineering and design to the vehicle owner. poor engineering and lack of willingness to fix a problem is sure to gain you a loyal following. i am almost ashamed to say i am from the detroit area and have been a proponent of buying from the big three.    i will upload the repair receipt once the repair action is completed."

"the steering in my car started tossing me from side to side.  i fortunately was able to get it to a shop 1 mile away only to find out the sensor kit and module kit (steering assist) needed to be replaced. pontiac had a recall on this make and model but my vin number was not one of them.  upon further investigation there has been 404 complaints for this exact reason.  this could end up costing someone their life.  when speaking with pontiac he stated my car was not a problem??? i was on the phone with him for an hour trying to stress the seriousness of this issue and he just continued to argue.  my car only has 96000 miles on it, he also stated had i a vin number that fell into their ""magical"" numbers and the deadline for the correction would have been may 31 but the issue happened june 1st they would not have fixed it.  pontiac knows this is a serious issue, they choose to ""pick and choose"" which vehicle they will fix.  i also tried to explain to him i know how a manufacturer works so their ""reasons and explanation"" was not correct. i stated to him:  they know there is a problem or there would not have been any kind of a recall.    i also ask him ""what if someone gets seriously injured?"" he stated ""they should have taken care of their vehicle"" nice comment for a big manufacturer to make to someone who is letting them know this is a major problem.  everyone needs to put in these complaints to stop the big manufacturers from doing this."
power steering assist / service advance track came on with no power to steer while driving.
while driving on the highway doing the speed limit of 70 the power steering assist fault light came on and then the car became very difficult and extremely hard to turn there was no warning it just happened quickly checked the power steering fluid everything was fine.  when looked up there showed a recall on some website and complaints the dealership told us there were no recalls.  i don't understand what or why this is happening.

"this is a complaint about the tesla autopilot.  here is a credible and easily verified report by a tesla owner in uk who has had a near death experience while on autopilot:  https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/at-what-point-do-i-say-enough-is-enough.100508/  **  a few weeks ago, the car whilst in auto pilot suddenly swerved across the motorway into the middle lane. i caught it half way across. the motorway was perfect. (interestingly at a supercharger, i asked the guy next to me if this had ever happened to him, and he said 'funnily enough, it had and just that very day for the first time' (that's not a coincidence surely) this was the final straw so i sent it off. sat nav, auto pilot, wont lock, returning to car with door open, doesn't present doors some of the time, doors don't close some of the time, screen goes black, etc etc etc. it acts with the consistency of a small child, yet its supposed to be software driven.  the autopilot issue is my biggest concern. the guy i spoke to who said his had done the same that day, said his drove towards a lorry. i thought it wasn't supposed to do that as it has sensors? it was very windy that day so i wonder if that was anything to do with it, either way tesla were so concerned about it, they didn't even bother to take the details of this guy when i raised this issue to them.**    even if the owner has his hands lightly on the wheel the power steering has sufficient power to wrench it out of his hands.  this autopilot is half-baked and glitchy and the constant software tweaks are making it even more dangerous.  no other car-maker would be allowed to conduct such a reckless experiment.  please take action before more lives are lost.  thank you.  concerned citizen etc.  "
"my 6 month pregnant wife was driving the truck when the dash read ""power steering assist fault"" she lost all power steering and was un able to control the vehicle. talked to ford dealership, they said rack is faulty. thankfully my wife, niece and unborn child where un harmed when the defective piece failed. this is a safety hazard and should be recalled immediately. if they were traveling at high speeds, she wouldn't have been able to control the vehicle on a corner."
"power steering assist failure indicated on instrument panel and full loss of any steering assist. steering requires/required lots of muscle to maintain any form of active driver intended steering changes. resulted in no injury, but very frightening occurrence at highway speeds. will take vehicle to dealer in the morning, vehicle mileage is 90k. a quick internet search shows this is a common problem for 2013 ford focus, so why no recall?"
"here is a complaint posted on the tesla forum about a total loss of power steering:  https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/broken-power-steering  snip** my wife called today to tell me her new tesla x had an error light that said service and power steering assist may be limited. i called my local center to inquire as to what to do next. i asked if the car was driveable, as at that time the steering seemed to be working fine. they said go for it, they'd look at the logs and get back to me. sure enough on my way home from an errand with my 3 kids in the car, the steering stopped working. thank god it was me driving, as there would be no way my wife would have been able to turn the wheel at all. i drove home carefully. after some research it seems this is an issue several others have gone through. many have noted a loose ground or other power connection issue. i find it unbelievable that i could find this out in a few moments on google, but when calling tesla service, they told me to go ahead and drive the car. when i called them back, and let them know their advice could have killed me or at least gotten me into an accident, i did not get much in the way of a response.**    this same failure is being discussed on many of the tesla forums.  this is unacceptably dangerous.  please take urgent action to protect lives.  thank you.  concerned citizen."

my power steering stopped working the message on my dashboard indicates that the power steering assist fault indicator illuminated. when this happen i was driving on a city street and had to pull over. i was able to get the car home and it's now parked in the driveway  i can't drive my car because it is very hard to steer without the power steering.  i have never received a recall notice regarding the problem
"problem first arose while driving ~60 mph on highway, there was a slight jerk of the steering wheel, as well as a dinging-alarm heard. did not notice a warning on the dash at the time, car drove fine the rest of the day besides this quick incident. a few days later, the power steering went out upon turning right at a stop light, steering was very hard but manageable. upon starting the car again later the same day, i noticed a message of ""power steering assist fault"" on my dash along with dinging heard, and no power steering at all. drove home without power steering, forced and difficult turning. found that there were recalls for this problem of my car, just not for my vin specifically."

"here is a tesla discussion thread in which a tesla owner reports that his power steering has fallen apart:  https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/power-steering-falling-apart.100951/  **snip - yesterday, all of a sudden, my steering started making some bad noises - clunks and screeches. today i removed the tub and found 2 of the 3 bolts that mount the electric steering assist to the rack had sheared off.  another 2 bolts, along with those 3, hold two parts of the rack together. one of those is also broken. it can't escape because it's too long to come out all the way where it's situated.  oddly enough, there are 3 more threaded holes (exactly adjacent to the 3 used in assembly) in the electric assist; so i didn't have to drill the broken ones out. i filed them down to flush and put 3 new bolts in. (the last one was bent.)  i'm pretty sure the originals are aluminum, but being sunday i just went to the local hardware store and bought what they had. btw they are 8mm x 1.25, 65mm long.**    i am certain that bosch  the maker of the steering rack would have had those bolts securely locked to prevent them from falling out.  tesla motors  have an unusual habit of using felt tip ""witness marks"" to monitor movement of many bolts on the cars. green marks on some bolts can be seen on the photograph of the steering box.  this suggests that they are not confident the bolts are securely fastened.  other car manufacturers ensure that all of their technicians are properly trained in the importance of securing fasteners correctly so that they will not loosen under vibration.    this loose steering assembly could easily have caused a fatal crash.  it is even more dangerous in the case of cars fitted with so called autopilot.  please investigate.  concerned citizen.

"the 2009 chevrolet malibu's have been recalled for the ""electric power steering assist"".  i currently own a 2009 chevrolet malibu and had an incident over the weekend in which my power steering assist was lost and steering wheel would not move and was locked in place.  after taking the vehicle to the local chevrolet dealership service center, they advised that these models have a recall for this issue, however, my vehicle was 1025 miles over the mileage to have it fixed under the recall.  after research on gm site on the nhtsa site, we found information collaborating this recall, in which it stated that under this recall the dealership has to fix this; however, my chevrolet malibu's vin number did not pop up on this recall.  nhtsa states that this problem affects 2009 chevrolet malibu's and does not list vin's affected.  we would assistance in having this vehicle also added to the recall list and having gm fix this problem which is a huge safety issue."
"this  veh. has forward emergency braking which never works as advertised and presented by nissan. a crash will result every time if you fail to brake. dealer says system is aligned and there are no codes, but it simply doesn't work. i test drove a second new veh. just like mine, it failed to work too. the nissan video on feb shows two independent warnings along with braking intervention if necessary to prevent a collision. well, this just never occurs. it simply does not work. i'm sure there are thousands of unsuspecting folks driving this veh. under a false sense of security. nissan will not admit to a problem with this system. i have read online threads of others making the same complaint i'm making. this veh. warrants independent testing as this system relates to safety."
this is a 5 year old car. with 750000 miles on it. the power steering assist has already died costing up $2k in money we don't have to fix it. the fix is replacing the entire rack and pinion. we had started for the first time the day it went out. we were parked i had to drive it to the dealership with no power steering. if you shut of the car it would temporarily fix it's self. and it did the guy at the dealer shut it down after seeing the no steering assist when he restarted the car it magically worked again. until next time that is.     ford knows this problem exist and refuses to issue a recall for all 2012 focus. this is a new car it should not be have these problems. putting us in financial strain.
steering assist failure notice appeared on and off for nearly a year. notice would disappear after turning vehicle off and straightening steering wheel. in the past 2 months the issue happens several times a day. last week it happened twice while i was driving and almost lost control and crashed.
"while adaptive cruise control is engaged the vehicle will brake on its own. this occurs when there are no other vehicles or objects in sight. the vehicle applies the brakes hard enough where if another car is following closely it could rear-end my vehicle. i have had the car in to circle porsche 5-6 times with no resolve. this was first reported to the dealer on june 29, 2015."
"my electrical steering is acting up, making a weird noise after i start my car,  is stiff at times and hard to turn. i received an error message, "" steering assist, service required"" on the dash recently. that message has gone, but the problem still exists     this is a danger to me when i drive. whenever i start my car, the steering is rigid and stiff in the city."

sudden failure of power steering while in motion. some warning with yaw control in days leading up to failure. was in motion in a straight line when failed. now has no steering assist at all. if this would of happened while in a curve or turn it could of resulted in a crash.
"when driving the affected vehicles in heavy rain or in deep puddles, the alternator belt may slip, causing the power control module (pcm) to incorrectly assume failure of the charging system. once the pcm assumes that the charging system has failed, the vehicle will stop charging and could result in poor acceleration, loss of steering assist and windshield wiper operation, and a possible engine stall, increasing the risk of a crash."""
"the vehicle was parked in my driveway upon returning from errands. the next morning the power steering assist and the advancetrac system failure lights were on. this has happened before while driving and after parking at my workplace. usually restarting the vehicle would correct the issue. this time it would not reset and i brought it to the ford dealership where it was purchased. i understand there was a recall on the 2012 ford fusion and other ford makes for this same issue. however the dealership says the vin # on my fusion doesn't match any current recall and will not cover the cost of repair. my question is if this is a known ford problem why should it not cover my vehicle with the same issue for recall ? just because the vin # isn't in the system is no reason not to fix this. it is a known problem,many situations exactly like mine recorded online. how are they (ford)not responsible?"
"while on the highway a  stabilitrack warning appeared on the dash stating it might affect power steering assist. this came on several times. then with the cruise control on and signaling a lane change the cruise was cancelled. this also occurred several times. it also appeared that the dash lights flickered ,but i wasn't sure because of the sunlight . later that evening i was making a turn on a city street when the dash lights went completely out and i had no power steering. this lasted about 2 seconds before everything came back on. after that episode it hasn't happened since. after reading other similar complaints i am concerned it could happen again and could result in a crash. it seems that when the cruise was cancelled when signaling the lane change, that if i pushed up or down on the turn signal lever at the end of the lever it would cancel the cruise control. i tried pushing down on the lever closer to the steering column and that didn't cancel out the cruise control. i don't know if it was just a coincidence or it just wasn't malfunctioning at the time."
"here is a model s in the junkyard: https://www.iaai.com/vehicle?itemid=26536335&rownumber=1&loadrecent=true    it has been in a major crash, it has bio-hazard stickers and judging by the damage it is almost certain that someone has been killed in the crash.    a blown up photograph is attached of the tire stowed in the rear of the car attached to the broken suspension parts.  the tread on this tire is completely worn away.  this car is less than a year old so that can not possibly be normal wear on the tire.  teslas are very prone to collapse of the suspension systems.   if the car is on cruise control or autopilot then even if the tire is rubbing hard against the wheel well due to a problem with the suspension the car will apply more power to compensate and the driver may be unaware that there is a problem until there is a catastrophic failure.  to make this absolutely clear - i believe that the suspension system in the teslas is defective and that the company is covering up these defects.  please launch a full investigation into this matter.  thank you.  concerned citizen.  date of crash is an approximation.  number of fatalities is a guess based on the damage to the car.

the power steering (electric steering assist) fails intermittently and without warning. this occurs either hot or cold. it occurs with vehicle stationary and in motion.

front emergency braking system failed to brake the car when there was another vehicle in front of the car and resulted in a crash. my car hit another car.
"while driving on a divided highway at 60 mph, i experienced a sudden loss of power steering assist. steering became very stiff and there was a strong burnt rubber smell emanating from the engine compartment. i drove about 6 miles further and parked the car in my driveway. i also noticed the battery symbol illuminated with warning message 'charging malfunction.' i had the car towed to the bmw dealership for repairs. i believe this is an identical issue that resulted in the bmw recall campaign no. 12v-550: engine belt idler pulley bolt for the x5. i am concerned because i believe the engine in my 335d is identical to the diesel engine in the x5 recall and believe the 335d should be included in this recall. i will be contacting bmw corporate headquarters about my concern."
"backing out of the driveway three days ago in my 2010 fusion and power steering assist failure message came across my dash.  usually turning the car off and on removes the message and returns the steering to normal. it did not do it this time.  talked to ford and they told me that my car was made 4 months to early to have a recall on the steering malfunction that was covered under the big lawsuit that was just settled. towed car to local ford dealership and diagnosed it as going to need whole new steering rack assembly. they said cost roughly about $1800 total with parts and labor for a part that is defective and is the same as the the recall for the car model year later. makes no sense to me why this isn't covered in recall also.  seems like a cover up on fords part and negligence and bad investigation practices by nhtsa.  i have leave coming up in the next three days where i am driving over 600 miles with my pregnant wife and 6 year old daughter.  i am glad this didn't happen while in motion like a lot of the other complaints i've been reading.  still makes no sense to me why this isn't covered under the recall just made.  i refuse to give ford that money for a defective part that isn't my fault it went out because shotty manufacturing.  nhtsa, cover all cars and models that have this dangerous defective part and ford do it for free!!!  car not fixed."
"while driving the vehicle, alarms go off and a notice saying 'steering assist fault' is displayed. this has happened 4 different time at random. 1 time, the steering completely went out and the vehicle lost all power steering. this is a huge safety concern as this is a family vehicle transporting very young children."

advancetrac and power steering assist fault errors come up in the message center. also lost power steering and i now have to manually steer vehicle.the vehicle was in the stationary position and came on when i started the car. the error message has not gone with shutting off and restarting the vehicle.
the power steering assist code keeps coming on on the dash every othee day for well over a year now. when that comes on you can barely steer the fricken thing when it happens. ive been lucky enough to have it happen while driving slow in town and havent had any accidents luckily. some very close calls though!
"i was driving on the freeway with the adaptive cruise control on at about 50 to 55 mph when suddenly the car went full acceleration. i tried to stop the car by turning off the cruise control, turn off the ignition, use the emergency brake, none worked. i then put the transmission and then everything worked, by then i was doing 90 plus miles per hour passing vehicles. i contacted gm and they tried find a problem but did not a problem.they said no codes appeared. this sudden acceleration lasted only a few seconds before i put the car in neutral. will a code appear if the problem lasted only a few seconds. gm closed the case."
"adaptive cruise control works part of the time and will not work part of the time.  the first few times it happened, it would start working after i turned the engine off and restarted it.  lately it will be off for several days and then work a few days before going off again.  after checking the internet for solutions, i found none but found literally hundreds of people that have the same problem.  i feel this is a safety problem because it causes unintentional speeding.  in addition, the adaptive cruise control prevents the car from getting too close to the vehicle in front of you.  after getting used to this feature, i find myself getting too close to other cars when the adaptive cruise control is not working.  this is the situation when the vehicle is moving."
"power steering assist failure on 2012 ford fusion. power steering assist light is on and there is no power steering. very dangerous as it gives out while the car is in motion. ford knows they have a larger problem with 2012 ford fusions (just read the complaints on this site) but have not expanded the recall and leaves these dangerous cars on the road where power steering stops working even while you are driving. ford dealer said car is not cover by warranty or by recall. cost to repair $1,600."
"active lane keeping assistant is very dangerous because the vehicle often will veer out of lane toward oncoming traffic or other obstacle. this occurs even though there are clear lane markings and all other requirements for system operation are met. it happens at higher speeds and at lower speeds as well. since the feature does operate correctly a high percentage of the time, the driver is put under extra stress having to be constantly on guard for when the car will veer off without warning. bmw literature and video say the system will make the drive more relaxed and the driver more rested but it is exactly the opposite. even though i know that the driver is always ultimately responsible, their video states that the system keeps the car in the center of the lane without driver steering input.     i have contacted bmw and my local dealer. all they say is that the system operates as designed. but it is very dangerous and will cause injury or worse.     additionally, ""with the system switched on, the person warning with city braking function and the side collision warning are active."" therefore, if you turn the system off because of the danger of veering out of lane, you will lose the safety features just mentioned.     i am very surprised and disturbed by bmw's failure to acknowledge and address the failures and dangers of the system.      being most interested in safety of my vehicle i always purchase all the safety features. in this situation i have been sadly disappointed in the reliability of the bmw technology."

"this is a complaint about the absolute madness of tesla autopilot.  here is just one more example of how dangerous this so called autopilot really is.  from today's forum posts.  https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/nag-reduced-with-2017-46.102558/    d21mike, today at 6:01 pm   bertx said: &#8593;   hold the wheel lightly with one hand just above the flat portion at the bottom, along the side, just letting the weight of your hand bear down. don't steer, but don't keep the ap from steering. you will never, ever get a nag. if you need to do something with your hands, then do it and put one back when you can. switch hands if you need to. prop your elbow on the console.  this is what i do as well. works really well. ***    this is contrary to the advice given by every driving school and every regulatory authority in the world.  having one hand loosely resting at the bottom of the wheel will not allow the driver to keep control of the vehicle . the marketing of this autopilot feature has been grossly irresponsible and the claim that it is 40% safer than a human driver is simply ludicrous.  internet forums and youtube videos show that owners are putting lives in danger by using this feature on narrow winding roads and in inappropriate situations.  tesla will always claim that autopilot was not engaged at the time of the crash because it disengages the moment before impact.  this is not a laughing matter.  please stop this madness before more lives are lost."

"tl* the contact owns a 2014 ford fusion. while driving 45 mph, the steering wheel seized and the power steering assist indicator illuminated. the vehicle was towed to suburban ford of waterford (5900 highland road, waterford twp, mi), but the cause of the failure was not determined. the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was notified and stated that an investigation was underway. the failure mileage was approximately 34,000. the vin was not available. "
power steering assist and advancetrac both failed at the same time. it is showing on the driver information screen. there are no codes with a code reader.
"the electronic steering assist is failing causing the vehicle to randomly lose power steering. this make the vehicle very hard to steer and control. the car is a 2012 and only has 30,000 miles. no recall has been issued yet other models with the same electronic steering assist has been recalled. this has happened twice now when the vehicle has stationary and we did not drive the car. seems the problem is intermittent and now we are afraid to drive the car, we don't want it to fail while we are driving and cause an accident or injury."
i was driving home this morning and the power steering assist fault came up. this fault has never been on before. i read a couple of online sites and it stated that there was a recall of 14s05 but it doesnt show for my vehicle. mine is the same year affected but does not apply for some reason.
"i received an error about my steering assistant and then my steering just went out.  it was extremely hard to turn the wheel and i was driving my mother home.  i am lucky we weren't both killed!  or killed someone else!!!  i was surprised to find out that my vin isn't covered as part of the recall that involves this same issue.  it will be $900 to fix and i'm unsure how to complain.  ford is an upstanding company that i though stood by its products but i'm finding out that may not be the case.  it is unfortunate to my family as well, since its only a few weeks until christmas but will need to pay this expense.    there is a sticker on the windshield that says it was made in kansas.  based on the recall in place that is the plant affected.  i can send a pic of that sticker if you need it."
power steering assist fault message in the message center when backing out of driveway on to the road.  power steering failed but was able to pull back into driveway.  turned car off and returned later and the error was gone when restarted the car.  has happened twice since 11/25/2017.  also while driving service advancetrac message appeared.  this was before the second power steering assist fault message occurred.  took to the ford dealer today but since the codes were gone from the message center they could not diagnose the problem.  told to drive the car back to dealer if the message happened again but if i have no power steering this is almost impossible.
"tl* the contact owns a 2012 ford focus. while driving approximately 10 mph, the steering assist warning indicator illuminated and the steering wheel became difficult to steer. the vehicle was taken to szott ford (8800 e holly rd, holly, mi 48442, phone: (248) 634-4411) where it was diagnosed that the rack and pinion failed and needed to be replaced. the vehicle was not repaired due to the repair fees. the manufacturer provided case number: cas13724060. no further assistance was offered. the approximate failure mileage was 90,700. *tt  updated 9/18/18*jb"
"my 2015 gmc canyon lost power steering traveling approximately 50mph on a mountain road on one of the first rainy days of the season. it felt like losing more than just steering assistance, as even at that rate of speed the wheel was nearly impossible to turn. i was lucky to be on one of the limited sections of straight road. rebooting the vehicle returned steering functionality.    dealer found code ""c0545 - steering torque sensor"" and performed safety recall #15595 where they replaced the torque sensor cover. i was charged $200 for the repair despite the recall notice explicitly stating it should be performed free of charge. i have not experienced loss of power steering in the month since the repair.    i contacted the gm regional rep, who stated that cars can have the same problem as a safety recall, and the same solution as a safety recall, but not be part of the safety recall. that was the justification for the $200 charge and the denial of reimbursement. gm further stated that they don't determine the criteria for a safety recall, it is all up to the nhtsa. in other words, they won't do the right thing unless the government forces them to.    in my opinion as an engineer, sensor + rain sounds like a plausible match for the symptoms and the problem identified by the safety recall that the dealer performed. i question whether the recall is missing some vin numbers, or if a very similar but independent problem exists on the same components, warranting a separate recall."
"https://youtu.be/z4thv5a3lrk    dynamic cruise control that stops and starts in bumper-to-bumper traffic is what sold me on this car. lamentably, i did not know hyundai excludes aeb from hybrid ltd ultras. as the video shows, frantic beeping from the forward collision warning system was not accompanied by any braking at all. i slammed on them too late.    i was in dcc mode when the warning sounded. dcc can gradually slow from freeway speed to a stop and resume, but fcw apparently cancels dcc's braking! this must be no more than a difference in software between gas-only and hybrid ltd ultras because all sensing and control hardware are identical.    hyundai's response to my inquiries are just repetitious confirmations of what i already discovered the hard and expensive way."
i was on my way to work. i was on hwy 109 going 45 mph. i was about four miles from my work and suddenly my power steering was not working the wheel was very hard to move. i could barely get it to my job. i made it there and turned off my car. i started it back up to see if that would fix the problem the a warning light popped up that said power steering assist fault. i still had no power steering. i called the dealership they came and got my car because there was a recall on the eps bolts. they called me the next day and said that wasnt the problem that i needed my steering rack replaced. i did some research and my car had no symptoms of the steering rack being bad. the wheel didnt shake and it wasn't hard to steer or keep my car in the lane . i can not understand how it could just go out with out warning. it is a very dangerous problem and i believe ford should be accountable. wjy isnt thos a recall. ive read multiple complaints for the same issue. what would have been the solution if i would have wrecked and been injured or if my special needa child was in the car and i wrecked. something needa to be done
"toyota prius prime 2017 lane departure warning with steering assist. this steering assist function does not work as it does in any other toyota model. i have spoken with toyota engineering and met with a toyota technical representative and they admit that the steering assist function does not work as it does in any other toyota model. as you will see from my attached document this function really doesn't work at all. i am not sure if this is a regulated safety feature or not but it was suggested by a toyota employee that i make the nhtsa aware of this failure as it could be a safety concern that should be looked at. i have driven at least 5 prius prime advanced and all have this problem in that the steering assist function does not work in any of them even though it is advertised and sold to the consumer as a integral part of the toyota safety suite that is on all toyota vehicles. this steering assist function does work on all of the other toyota models as advertised and as a consumer would expect. please review my attached document that describes the problem and my attempts to get toyota to correct this problem. the stock answer i have received from most toyota representatives is that the steering assist ""works as it is engineered to do"" my stock answer to this is why does it function differently than every other vehicle equipped with the toyota safety suite. i have never received a coherent reply to that question."
"my vehicle was subject to safety recall 14s05. i am the 2nd owner, and according to ford the recall repair was completed in 2014(reprogramming the pscm. however, the actual torques sensor in the steering column was not replaced. this morning it went out on me on my way to work while exiting i96 wb in wixom, mi. we had 7 inches of snow fall last night, so road conditions were snowy and icy. when the electronic steering assist went out, the vehicle only had manual steering, which is very difficult to use. as a result, i temporarily lost control of the vehicle, nearly striking another motorist. i then corrected the steering wheel back in the other direction, and ran off the left shoulder of the road into a snow drift. i was not injured, and there was no damage sustained by my vehicle. i was able to get the vehicle out of the snow drift under it's own power, and continued on to work.  i am very lucky to be writing this complaint today, i very nearly could have suffered serious injury or death, or injured or killed another motorist.  i researched this problem on the internet to try to diagnose, only to find that this is a prominent problem with these vehicles, and that the safety recall had been issued. but as i soon learned, like many, many others, after the initial recall repairs are completed, ford will no longer do any other remedies for this problem. i find this to be alarming, and unacceptable. as of right now, the condition still exists, and i am trying to get estimates on the repairs. i would like this issue to be investigated thoroughly, and i believe that there is more to this problem than simply reprogramming the pscm. i believe that the steering torque sensor and/or steering column is more likely the problem, and that ford should fix or replace as necessary."
"driving on the highway and city street it has happened at least 3 times in the last couple months, the park assit, stabillity track and last night the steering assist came on along with other lite lights brake, abs which i have recorded on my phone. at the moment its at the dealer, per service advisor they "" had the truck on drove it and has happened of now to them, requested to keep another day to recheck tomorrow."
"on 12/8/2017 i drove me car downtown nashville from my house.  parked it in the gultch area.  walked to a return.  came back to my car and the steering assist fault light came on.  it said contact dealer.  i tried turning the car off and on again several times.  the steering wheel would turn with great effort, however i was parallel parked and there was no way i was getting the car out of the position it was in without needing a tow truck.  so i had to have it towed to the ford dealership.  once there it took them 5 days to tell hook it up to the computer and tell me that i needed almost $2,300 worth of repairs.  so basically while the car was parked, it broke.    i declined service at the moment and am actively searching for solutions.  the dealer diagnostic was as follows:  ""found u3000-49 pscm internal failure.  followed pinpoint test b and found needs rack replacement.""  the car was purchased in jan 2013 from a car max.  i payed for the extended warranty that they sold me as 100,000 mies ""over the purchase milage"", to which they have been kind enough to inform me actually meant 100,000 miles total.  i'm right at the 113,500 neighborhood.  i have exactly two payments left.   so now not only do i have to borrow or rent a car ($$$) i will loose money if i trade it in, i have to burden someone else with the use of my car to work.  which has affected my ability to earn a living and pay my bills.  top that off with the service charge of and extra $2,300 out of pocket.  ford, we need to talk."

the power steering assist fault came up while i was driving through a sharp turn and almost caused an accident. went away on its own and next day came in again and since then my car is hard to steer and dangerous to drive. there was a recall of 14s05 but it doesnt show for my vehicle. mine is the same year affected but does not apply for some reason and dealership is refusing to take any action to remediate.
"started fine, put into drive and steering froze..""steering assist failure"" on screen. repaired at ford dealer. new steering box and column.  only 28000 miles on vehicle and 3 year warranty ended august 2016. heard that other ford models like focus were covered by ford."
"while attempting to park my tesla s75 d in a costco space, the car bolted. it felt like it was in autopilot mode without me engaging it manually. i slammed on the brakes. it hit the rear bumper of the car parked in front. fortunately, it didn't do any damage to that vehicle but it caused plenty of damage to my front end. i'll need a new bumper and hood. it also deactivated my autopilot and radar which are behind the bumper. i can still drive the car and feel fairly safe as i believe the computer accidentally engaged the autopilot and now the autopilot isn't operational. however, i no longer trust this car. i've presented this problem to tesla and they said is was user error but there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that i was not at fault. i've done research and there is a class action lawsuit in the works as this has happened to other tesla users. my advise, don't  buy a tesla!!!!!"

"received a ""steering assistance fault"" warning light on the dash display after starting the vehicle which resulted in not being able to turn the steering wheel without extreme effort.. after turning off the car, it reset and began functioning. approximately a week later it happened once more after starting the car, and once again it reset and was drivable. this is a very serious condition and possibly deadly if not corrected. i did research and found that there are many, many instances of the same issue with other ford products such as fusions, explorers, lincolns and many others that did have a recall. why has the focus not been recalled with the same issue.   this should be investigated and expedited to make the ford motor company responsible for any repairs at their cost and a recall should be issued to save lives."
"power steering assist fault!   ford has recalled some of these for this reason but refuse to accept mine in their recall . it makes it virtually impossible to steer when it fails.luckily i was in a department store parking lot. i have a 2013 with 66,000 miles on it."
"a notice on the dash appeared at startup(stationary) , stating power steering assist fault service required. this makes steering very difficult. this has happened before but the warning would go away on next start up. when i took it to a mechanic i was told that no codes were showing. i have had my car at a ford service department and they told me there are no open recalls or bulletins."

"without warning the engine and all electrical components (interior and exterior lighting, radio, wipers, ac-heat/blower, brake assist, steering assist, airbag, speed indicator, etc) all shut off. there are no dash warning lights. the dashboard is completely black for a moment (until restart). this happened while the car was warm (after driving at highway speed for over 15min). this happened while the car was travelling at approximately 35-miles per hour on a city street. i was able to put the car in neutral and immediately restart without stopping. this was an extremely dangerous situation. if i was on a poorly lit road or going around a corner, or at a higher speed, or a less experienced driver, this could easily have been a fatal accident. this was previously reported to chrysler and thye reported the problem 'fixed' less than 1-year ago (reported to chrysler corporate in early august 2017 and supposedly fixed by a chrysler dealership august 11 2017). the problem is not fixed. this happens without warning and very limited (less than once per month). it seems more frequent in cold weather. it has happened at other times, often a minute or so after starting the vehicle, while warming up. it has happened other times while driving (about 4-times since purchase in november 2014), but i do not recall the dates and time."

"tl* the contact owns a 2006 pontiac g6. while driving 35 mph after stopping and attempting to make a right turn, the steering wheel was difficult to turn. the contact also mentioned that it was difficult to turn the steering wheel to the left. the contact stated that a power steering assist failure was displayed. the vehicle was not taken to an independent mechanic or dealer for diagnostic testing or repairs. the manufacturer was notified and informed the contact to take the vehicle to a local pontiac dealer for diagnostic testing. the failure mileage was approximately 79,000."
"there is a current recall out for certain models of the g6 for electronic steering assist failure. as well as u joint issues. i believe my car is affected. my power steering only works correctly when its under 70 degrees. and it only works for a short time. ive owned this car for 5 years and never once had a full day where the steering worked like it should. dealer says my car is not affected and wants me to pay for a new steering motor. as for the u joint issue with steering. ive spent well over $2,000 on trying to get my steering/suspension fixed and it still has problems. i have to get the vehicle aligned every month. the steering either jolts to one side when going over a bump. or another way when flooring it. its beyond dangerous! when turning a corner, you have to straighten out the wheel yourself or else the car will continue to go where the wheel it turned. i fear taking this car on the highway. after getting vehicle aligned, alignment only works for 2 weeks, then it back to where problems started."
"my ford escape gave me a warning of the power steering assist fault and then my power steering stopped working. after doing research ford covered 2008 escape models as a recall, but my vin number said mine was made at a different factory so it is not covered."
"brand new vehicle.  driving on an interstate at 55mph and made a slight left turn at a bend in the road, well within the clearly painted lane markers. clear weather, temp about 50 degrees f. heard one beep and lost control of the steering for a second while the car steered itself slightly left.  my hands were on the steering wheel and i was active operating the vehicle.  startling!  happened two more times. took it to a dealer and he explained that i might not be used to electronic steering.  the same day, on a two lane road at 35 mph, at a slight left bend in the road, one beep and lost steering for about a second but enough to take the vehicle to the edge of the shoulder.  i was startled again and turned sharp left, crossing the double yellow line into the oncoming lane. fortunately, there were no vehicles in the lane.  the culprit seems to be the ""lane keep assist"" feature of the eyesight system where the vehicle's computer takes over control if it detects a lane departure under certain conditions. obviously, it is not functioning correctly and could have caused an accident or worse.  turned lka off."
"i came to a full stop as i was about to exit a driveway.  since there were no vehicles approaching from either direction and there were no obstacles in front of me, i stated to pull out of the driveway when the autonomous emergency braking system suddenly and abruptly stopped my vehicle with no justification. this type of system failure can result in injury."
"brakes failed. coming to a stop sign on cr 13, brake pedal went to the floor. brakes did not slow or stop  the car at all. pumped the brakes 3 or 4 times, no braking. went thru stop sign hitting another vehicle. air bags did not deploy. automatic braking system did not activate. estimates i was 50 yards from the stop sign when i first applied the brakes, speed between 20-30 mph."
"the first time the vehicle malfunctioned, i was driving in a grocery store parking lot with a personal friend and suddenly the car's emergency brake protection activated jolting the car to a stop. the second occurrence was in a parking deck (different from the first location) and the car again activated the emergency brake protection system jolting the car to a stop. i then felt this was a safety issue and brought this into the nissan dealership. they checked the car and called reporting they could not find anything wrong with the car and i should pick it up. i picked the car up and continued to drive it until i switched cars with a personal friend who used the car to drive one mile back to home down a 4 lane road. upon coming to an intersection, she reports she began slowing down and got in a turn lane to make a left onto our neighborhood road and as she was approaching the light, the car activated the emergency braking system, again jolting the car to a stop. she states during and after the car came to a complete stop, she kept her foot on the break the entire time and while decompressing the brake, the car then jolted forward crashing into the car in front of her. i had the car towed in to the nissan dealership and had corporate nissan step in to investigate the car. 6 weeks later they investigated the car reporting that no error was found with the car and again i should pick my vehicle up. i requested specific tests and asked the testing process for the car and was advised by the investigation department that they could not disclose that information and that the testing and results were ""property of nissan"" and that they were not offering any further assistance."
"2012 ford focus had intermittent steering assist fault warnings. since 12/24/2017 the fault warning does not go away and i have no power steering. i called 2 different ford dealers, they both denied any knowledge of any known problems with this problem. i did a tiny bit of research and quickly found that many other owners are having the same problem and that your agency has had complaints and are or did investigate this problem. is this caused by an exposure to extreme heat from other engine components? the faults always started upon starting the car and i would turn the car off and back on,it would go away but know it won't go away and i cannot drive it without power steering."
"reversing the car out of my garage i noticed the steering wheel was very difficult to turn and the ""steering assist fault"" message came up on the dash. car is still driveable, but very difficult to turn steering wheel at low speeds. i took the car to the ford dealer. they say they carried out the recall affecting the steering safety bolts from 2015 (15s14) and that this is a new problem. they say i need a new steering gear/rack. it looks like a lot of people are experiencing the same issue. i'm lucky i was just reversing out of my garage and not driving at speed when the steering assist failed. that would have been very dangerous."
power assist steering fault appears on the dashboard. as i was driving down the street at 7:00 pm my steering wheel locked up and my dash read power steering assist fault. i then ran over a median and almost pulled a muscle trying to bring the car back on to the road. i called the ford company and the rep stated that my vin was not one of the affected vehicles. i then took my car to a ford service shop and they have advised that this is the same exact issue that was recalled. needless to say i am without a car while the repair remains over 1500.00.
"the car displayed multiple errors on its multi-information display. the errors include brake system problem, abs problem, road departure mitigation system problem, and adaptive cruise control problem. those error messages went away on my way to elk grove acura but i was able to record them on my phone. there was still an error message in the acuralink system for the electric power steering that i showed the service advisor. he deleted the message without telling me and said those errors are caused by a low battery. he went to test the battery and it tested fine so i was told that there was nothing to fix. he sent me home after refuse my request to document the errors with acura. he made it like i never brought the car in and those problems never existed."
"i was driving on busy four-lane highway in fast moving traffic in my 2012 ford focus a light came on saying steering assist failure service required.  this scared me very much.  it was very dangerous and lifethreatening.  the wheel was heavy and hard to steer getting off the highway curving exit.  i was frightened i would hit the guardrails.  brought car to torrington, ct ford dealer who is very nice said steering gear assembly needs to be replaced $1,977.  called ford asked why was focus excluded from recall issued for same reason to edge, fusion and explorer.  ford representative named pam said ""reason it was not involved in recall is because built at different time and using different part affected by the recall.""  i said but they all used same temkin manuf. part.  he said, ""recalls are vin specific.""  would not pay for repair, and said my complaint would be forwarded to the ""appropriate internal department"".  (that must be the do-nothing-about-it unit) how disappointing and embarrassing that an american company doesn't care about its customers. this is my third and last ford car i will buy.  who is going to die before big business takes notice?  there are 508 complaints on this website for the same problem with this vehicle!! and thousands more on other internet sites!  why are we spinning our wheels with this agency that does nothing with this life-threatening issue. what is more important than being able to steer or brake your car?  this steering assist failure is deadly and needs to be investigated and recalled for safety of 2012 ford focus drivers, their passengers, and other drivers on the road.-- tk (former ford driver)"
"my power steering assist module was failing intermittently through october/november 2016. finally in december 2016 it decided to fail completely. luckily i wasn't on the road, it failed after parking the car and has been undrivable ever since. i can start it, roll it forwards and back in a straight line, but the steering is locked and won't budge. i have a little over 39000 miles on it and is just out of warranty because of that."
on three separate occasions while driving approximately 45 mph a message to service the stabiltrak comes up and the vehicle loses power steering assist. the vehicle is almost impossible to turn at that point. after turning the vehicle off and back on the error clears and the vehicle drives like normal.
"power steering assist fault warning light came on about two weeks ago while i was driving, turned car off for a few minutes and it disappeared.  the next day it reappeared while i was driving and never turned back off, luckily was down the street from my home & wasn't in danger of causing an accident.  now along with that warning light came service advancetrac.  took the vehicle to the dealership, paid $129 for a diagnostic test, was informed that it was going to cost me nearly $2,000 to get my car fixed.  why was the recall for this same exact issue only for 2011-2013 models of the same exact car with the same exact parts?!?!!?!?"
"while driving to work this morning on the highway. the power steering assist and the  advanced traction control functions both alarmed and stopped working. i was able to get to work, but now i cannot steer at all. both warning lights are illuminated and both functions continue to not work."

"lost power steering as i was driving through a parking lot. saw the message on the dash ""power steering assist fault"". called ford dealership to get my vehicle looked at but they are booked 2 weeks full. asked about recall 14s05 but they told me my vin was not part of the recall. i contacted ford and they gave me the same information. can not drive vehicle as it is too dangerous in winter. this issue seems to be very common with the 2008 mercury mariner and especially ones that were not part of the recall for the same exact issue."
"vehicle's steering wheel begins to vibrate out of control when attempting turns. this violent shaking poses serious dangers to driver while making turns, and causes driver to pull off of road and completely turn car off. problem noticeable for approximately 1 month intermittently before problem began occurring without fail every single time vehicle was driven. when taken to toyota dealership in bloomington, in, mechanics said entire rack needed replacing, estimating a total much higher than value of car itself. no recall found for this problem, no paperwork provided to customer. once customer paid for diagnostic charges and took vehicle back, power steering warning lights are permanently enabled and steering assist is completely off, causing turning to continue to pose threat, although steering wheel does not vibrate, yet."

"my 2013 ford taurus sho exhibits the same characteristics documented in nhtsa campaign number: 15v340000. when i search by my year make and model, i see a steering recall. however, when i put in my vin, no recall appears. ford says the recall only applied to specific vin numbers in 2013 and my vehicle was not among those.  my vehicle experiences intermittent steering sluggishness and i fear the steering may fail. when i took the vehicle to an independent mechanic they said they must break the seal on the automatic steering to determine why it's failing. also, the steering did not exhibit the behavior during a short test drive.    i contacted jerry's ford in alexandria who said they will not honor the recall because of my vin. how can we have someone look into my vehicle to assess it's applicability to this existing recall?"
"message came on: power steering assist fault.  did search that my vin number was not covered but its the same year, make and model and place of manufacturing  of the recall in 2014.  message did not come on as result of accident, i was just driving on street when it came on."
i got 2 messages pop up; power steering assist fault and service advancetrac.   all of the sudden my power steering failed and i nearly ran into another car while turning right.
"battery acid from the manufacturer's original battery leaked, and damaged the transmission wiring harness, which sits underneath the battery. until detected, this caused sporadic warnings and multiple malfunctions while driving that would appear, but then go away. some months later, the car started but the computer would not shift from park. the instrument cluster listed numerous, unrelated system issues: ""adaptive cruise control problem"" ; ""stop driving when safe. transmission problem. see manual."" ; ""electric parking brake problem"" ; ""emissions system problem"" ; ""transmission system problem"" ; ""transmission problem apply parking brake when parked"" ; ""vehicle stability assist (vsa) problem"" ; ""precision all wheel steer problem"" ; ""collision mitigation system problem"" ; ""road departure mitigation system problem"" ; ""blind spot info system problem.""     this vehicle has a shift-by-wire drive selector, and there is no mechanical way for a consumer to disengage the transmission from the drivetrain. the vehicle was stuck in park and needed special equipment to be safely moved onto a tow-truck, which took the manufacturer's roadside service two days to address.     the wiring harness was replaced under warranty, but took several days for a repair. the 2015 acura tlx seems to be known for reacting in this way for any type of electrical or voltage variability from any number of its electronic systems, including while driving."

i was driving and while turning i lost steering assist controls. no power steering at all. i all most crashed in mid turn.
"returning to maryland from indiana in several locations along i-70, i-79, i-68 auto braking engaged for no reason at all. road crews plow with blade slightly above pavement possibly avoiding damage to rumble strip so we can't see lane divider lines or edge of road solid line when accidently touch the rumble strip brakes engage immediately when beeps alone should suffice. other times it appeared the system thought we were about to have a head on collision and again braked suddenly and often. we think the headlights of cars way off in the distance where trees near them created a kind of strobe effect fooled the sensors where ever they are. i had to cancel all safety systems to avoid more problems like this. solution recommended: require honda to allow us to turn off auto braking in bad weather so sensors don't cause panic to drivers not understanding what's happening. when roads are slick as ours were you really don't want vehicles sliding out of control because of a system intended to keep us safe. i can tell you drivers around us thought we were intentionally trying to cause mischief and i'm certain the only reason we did not have an accidental is because i put blizzac snow tires on my 2018 crv touring and kept my thumb over the cancel button so i could recover quickly but eventually had to disable all that because it happened too often. i get cramps in my leg when i can't use cruise control and i paid a lot of money so i would be able to use adaptive cruise and other safety systems that simply made this car more dangerous. i'm angry, frustrated and want something done about this!!! yes roads were sloppy, slick and traveling below speed limit of 70 because of conditions. only when we got to maryland did conditions improve. had to drive 1/3 of our 550 mile trip with these problems happening disengaging entirely after hagaarstown md. can't trust it."
"electric power steering assist fails and car is unable to be steered.  this happens while driving, with very unsafe situation.    this is not a nuisance, it is totally unsafe as car control is lost when this happens.    recalls appear to have been initiated surrounding this problem, i need to find out if this is the case.  ford must stand behind fixing this unsafe condition."
"on dec 27, 2017, i started my car & received the power steering assist fault message on my dashboard & was unable to move my car. i was parked in my work parking lot. i had my car towed to lithia ford in grand forks, nd & was told by my ford service department the power steering control module was faulty and needed to be replaced. they stated it is part of the steering column and the steering column would not work without replacing the pscm. my ford protect warranty did not cover the issue and my 2013 ford explorer falls outside of the manufacturing dates of the recall 14s06 (14v286000 steering: electric power assist system), as told to me by ford motor company. i have tried, along with the service manager at lithia ford, to get ford motor company to get my car included in this recall as it experienced the same issue. as of jan 4, 2018, ford motor company stated they can't help me since i already got by car fixed."
was driving car and randomly a warning came up ' power steering assist fault service required'  then power steering turned off. turn car off turn back on fix the problem. then problem came back and has not gone away. i have no power steering.  radio has been acting strange since purchased car
"truck dash will flicker and cause stabletrak to disable, and then steering assist says limited.  radio will change stations when this happens, and the steering wheel will lock up and is unable to be turned.   has happened several times while we're on the highway.  it's when we're in motion, has happened while trying to park, going on a back road, and on the highway.  while in park, we can hear occasional clicking coming from inside the dash.  it's been occurring since october, but was really bad on december 22nd.  have a video of one of the occurrences, but not sure how to upload it."
attempted to come to a stop at a parking spot in front of a shop but car sped up and collided with a wall 6 feet in front of the car.  automatic braking system did not work or engage at slow speed.
my vehicle gives me warning codes out of no where collision assist inoperable  blind spot assist in operable. lost all power getting on hwy  shut vehicle off restarted now it drives still getting error messages
"while sitting in a parking lot or driving down the road, the steering wheel turns a distance of 2 inches back and forth on its own.  when i turned my vehicle on recently, an error message appeared on the dashboard saying ""electronic power steering assist failure"" and the wheel was very hard to turn.  after turning it a certain distance it freed up again and i was able to make it to my next destination without any further problems besides the wheel trying to turn itself."
"i was stopped in a lane waiting to do a michigan left turn, in city traffic.  the engine stumbled, a chime went off, and i got an error message ""power steering assist fault"".  the engine stalled.  i re-started the vehicle and had no power steering.  there was no way i could complete the turn and i had to get out of the vehicle (temperature of 14f) and wave vehicles behind me around me.  the dealer said that ford knew about marginal quality parts and was selective about replacing them."
when driving down the highway the car picks up a guardrail and thinks it is an object. the automatic braking system turns on and there is a grinding brake that gets applied while you are doing 65 mph on the highway. it's really unsafe.
"for the past 4-5 days, the power steering was going out completely whenever i tried to maneuver in parking spaces. i would have to turn the car off then back on to regain power steering assistance. tonight as i was driving on a very busy road the power steering went out again, luckily in front of a service station where i was able to pull in slowly and was told i have an electric steering system. i did some research and found out there was a recall for my model year for this exact issue but when i called the local ford dealerships to have it fixed, they all told me my vin wasn't covered in the recall and they wouldn't fix it. i have found numerous complaints online from people with the same issue."

"after turning on my 2013 ford explorer after being stationary the power steering assist fault warning light came on making the car hard to steer. after bringing it to my local ford dealer, they informed me that my vehicle was not under the specific recall as the other 2013 ford explorers from 2014, although it is experiencing the same issue."
"i received an error code on my 2013 ford explorer that stated ""checks brakes"" whenever i made a left or right turn. the car would also do a hard jerk when i turned and it was hard to drive at certain speeds.  when i did a vehicle check, my brakes were registering as ""ok"". a couple of days later, my vehicle did the same thing when i made a turn. this time after the check brakes warning light came on, my car completely cut off on me. i was able to re-start it but i was really nervous and immediately took it to the ford dealership. i contacted the service department the next day on the status of my vehicle and was told that 40 different error codes came up when they did a diagnostic test. i was told that my car has a ""steering gear issue"" and to replace it, i will have to pay $1683.87. i was able to find  complaints on the 2013 ford explorer with the same issue. recall number 14v286000 dated 20140529 for steering:electric power assist system is for 2011-2013 ford explorers. the recall states 'vehicles manufactured may 17, 2010, through february 28, 2012 may experience an intermittent connection in the electric power steering gear, which can cause a loss of the motor position sensor signal resulting in a shut down of the power steering assist.""  i contacted ford headquarters about the recall and was told that my car was manufactured after the recall date so the recall does not apply to my vehicle. i stated the my vehicle is having the same exact issues as the recall on the same make, model and year ford explorer. a case was opened by ford headquarters for financial assistance on january 5th, 2018. i an still awaiting a response. i do not feel safe driving my vehicle and i have resulted in renting a vehicle or having my husband drive me and our three kids back and forth. my car is at ford service center and i will eventually have to pick it up."
"while i was driving on a highway , i heard some bell noise coming from the dashboard and glanced down to see the following message ""power steering assist fault"". i also noticed that the steering was no longer ""power steering"".  i slowed down and put my flashers on and slowly drove home. while at home, i researched and found that ford had a recall back in 2015 (15s18) for this same year car for the same problem. for some reason, my vin was not part of the recall even though my car was manufactured at the same facility and within 30 days prior to the beginning recall date."
"electric steering assist failure -- sudden and complete failure.   on highway...outside temp was 5 f above zero.  two children in car (one year old and 3 year old).  without warning (and during a 45 degree curve) the steering assist went out and at first the steering assist attempted to correct the steering and that made matters worse -- holding the wheel steady and continuing thru the turn was a challenge (and, i am 'stout' guy!).  got off the highway asap.  then an electric burn smell started..steering column (?).   got the grand kids out of the car (into the 5 degree temp) in a hurry!   car now in the shop .  $2,000 repair and may not be complete.  will find out final  number today."
"my vehicle was covered under recall 14s05 and said recall work was done in 2014 in va under the previous owner, ford does not have record of what ""step"" or part of the recall was done, there are 3 parts.  less than 4 years, the recalled part, the torque sensor in the power steering assist has faulted, which leads me to believe that it wasn't replaced under the recall.  since it's been more than 12 months or 12,000 miles they are not willing to replace the said recalled part that was originally covered.  the car was in drive when the assist faulted causing steering to be very difficult and had i been driving at a higher rate of speed could have potentially been accident causing.  i feel that the recall work should be extended to replacing the part since it wasn't done originally under the recall or was again replaced with a faulty sensor to fault again within less than 4 years"

"on dec 29, 2017 driving my 2008 mazda tribute the steering wheel began shaking and vibrating uncontrollably while driving 70 mph on the interstate. i became extremely nervous and afraid of being stranded or even worse wrecking. luckily, i went straight to a local mechanic and when he started it up the steering wheel had completely locked up and the error 'power steering assist fault' was displayed on the dashboard. this was the first time it had ever happened and after running the diagnostic test the code b2278 indicated that there had been a recall nhsta # 14v282000 in 2014 causing the loss of power steering. the mechanic contacted the local mazda dealership to confirm if the recall had been done. the recall was on the steering torque sensor which affects the ability to properly detect the driver steering input. the mazda dealership confirmed that the recall was completed in 2014 and mazda was not going to replace the sensor again. i decided to drive to the dealership which was another 30 minutes away, but now the steering wheel was locking up and extremely difficult to turn the wheel. so after they inspected the tribute i was told that it needed the torque sensor replaced and it would cost me $877 and if that didn't fix it then they would have to replace the whole part. so the torque sensor did not fix the issue and the dealership said the steering wheel is shaking even more uncontrollably. now i have another $1500 i have to pay and totaling $2400. after researching this particular situation there are numerous complaints over the exact same problem, therefore this should be honored under a recall. in addition the part that's needed is on back order and my vehicle won't be ready until the first week of february."
this car has started to show signs of bad build quality. 1st 2 days after buying the car all the lights on the dash came on so i had to take it in for a module replacement. 2nd the car is very loud ( the road noise and engine noise) worse noise i've ever heard from a new car and sound like it's has exhaust leaks. t|e vehicles ride is very hard like the struts are worn or bottoming out and it's not the 17 inch tires as my fusion has 17's. the vehicle is difficult to keep in its lane even with all of the lane keep technology i have a hard time staying straight especially when i hit bumps the car hops around like it has worn struts. the transmission shifts into 1st gear hard on pulling away from a stop.
"when attempting to pull away from a gas pump at a filling station, my power steering abruptly quit working and a warning came up on my screen saying something about power steering assist.  the vehicle is a 2010 ford fusion.  it placed me in a very difficult and potentially dangerous situation since it was during rush hour at the station.  this lack of power steering increased the chance of a vehicle crash of some kind.  i purchased this vehicle new from a dealer in topeka, ks.    at the time of the incident, the vehicle had less than 40,000 miles and is in excellent condition.  i am a recently widowed 70 year old woman weighing less than 100 lbs and i cannot turn a vehicle without power steering.  the vehicle required replacing the electric power steering gear assembly costing me $1,266.33.  this same issue was recalled for 2011 and 2012 ford fusions, but no recall for 2010.  please explain why a recall was not also done for 2010 fusions since the issues were identical regarding shut down of  power steering.  i do not know how to send the invoice with this complaint, but can send it separately if possible"

"the adaptive cruise control system is dangerous.  the vehicle slams on the brakes when approaching vehicles ahead and the vehicle behind me then has to slam on their brakes.  this has happened multiple times.  so far i have avoided an accident, but there have been times that it was a very close call.  the vehicle behind me had to swerve to another lane to avoid hitting me.  the system is very jerky, speeding up and slowing down when following a vehicle ahead.  it will speed up by 2-3 mph and then slow down and speed up again.  i have made sure that the windshield is clear to allow for the camera to see the vehicle in front of me.  i had a previous ford motor vehicle and their adaptive cruise control worked wonderfully."
"on september 1, 2016, i leased a new 2016 buick envision, solely to get updated safety technology that was not on my 6-year old buick regal.  i had seen the envision at car shows, had picked up sales literature there and at local dealership, plus received online information.  this vehicle was advertised as having front end collision alert with automatic braking. in april 2017, i received a letter from buick/gm that my vehicle doesn't have the auto braking and there had been an error in their sales products.  i immediately wrote to them.  a couple months later i received a call offering me 1 year of onstar, 1 year extension of warranty, or $1500 accessories certificate.  i explained that i don't use onstar, the existing warranty runs the length of my lease, and that there is no need for $1500 accessories on a fully-loaded $48000 car.  so i wrote another letter, to which there was no response until i filed a claim with the ohio attorney general's office.  again i was offered the same 3 selections for my ""inconvenience"".  this isn't an inconvenience.  it could be a life and death situation.  the front end braking was the main reason for purchasing this vehicle.  it seems false advertising requires more than a letter."

"i own a 2017 volkswagen passat sel premium.  one of my primary concerns is that the autonomous emergency braking system does not function according to page 271 of the owner's manual, or as promoted by their dealers, and in tv commercials.  i took my passat to two dealers, both supposedly checked it and said it tested 100%  a week later, the car did not slow at all when i was close to a vehicle in front of me going 65 miles and hour and it slammed on its brakes. if i had not been paying attention, a serious accident would have occurred.  i wrote a letter regarding my concerns to mr. hinrich woebcken, ceo of vw of america. the response from vw was that my system works fine according to their dealers, and they will do nothing further for me!  after that, i did some research and discovered the results of front collision  prevention testing that was done by the insurance institute for highway safety. their tests on 2017 cars included those of over 20 manufacturers.  there are 3 different parts to the test:  forward collision warning (on the passat this is a two car symbol in the instrument cluster)   low speed auto brake (this is for speed under 12 mph)  high-speed auto brake (this is for speeds over 25 mph)    the results of these tests shows that all comparable manufacturer's sedans either scored 2 or 3 points on the high-speed auto brake test. however the vw passat scored ""0"" points, and was unable brake the car or reduce the car speed at all! the 2017 vw touareg also failed the high- speed auto brake portion of the test.     i feel that vw needs to inform owners, and stop advertising that their cars have a functioning high-speed auto braking, as they do not! they should quickly come up with a fix, and recall all 2016 to 2018 passats, and other models that have this faulty system!  drivers have a false sense of security for a system that does not work!

"on saturday, 1/27/18 at 9:17am mountain time we were driving in a residential neighborhood following a silver suv.  as we approach an intersection with a green light, the suv in front of us turned on their blinker to slow down to make a right turn.  we were following behind at a safe distance.  the suv slowed down considerably to make the turn, but we remained behind at a safe distance as the suv made the turn.  the automatic collision detection system on our honda odyssey flashed a warning, as i've seen before, and the warning was appropriate given the situation.  the suv completed its turn and i reapplied the gas in the intersection.  as i did so, the vehicle automatically braked, very hard, causing us to almost come to a complete stop in the intersection.  i assume that we were traveling at a speed of appx 15 miles per hour as we entered the intersection.  we were almost rear-ended by the car behind us (who honked at us, and with good reason).    there was absolutely no need for the automatic braking to engage in this situation.  furthermore, the braking would have happened much too late to avoid a collision had one been imminent.  the feeling of losing control of driving your own vehicle is extremely unsettling.  while i like the idea of the automatic braking feature, this event is incredibly concerning.    no one was hurt and nothing was damaged luckily.  but, this easily could have caused a significant accident."

the lane keeping assist and/or lane braking assist will violently move the vehicle unassisted by driver onto access roads  the driver expects the vehicle to maintain its position of the highway and not to violently turn onto access roads..  it is particularly unsafe on 75 and 85 mph speed limit highways. requires driver to violently jerk wheeler back to the highway being traveled upon.  calls directly to mercedes indicate no  interest in the problem and software involved and local dealers either will not set up appointments for inspection or/and indicate they cannot correct the software or sensitivity of detectors on right side of care.    the only way to avoid this is on a 4 lane high by staying in the center passing lane a lane away from exits.
the power steering assistance light has turned on and turning is difficult. right now the car is still drivable but needs strengths to make your turns. the problem occurred on february 1st 2018 i went to start driving my car and it is steering power assist light turned on. you still able to get to work i'll just have to use a lot of strength for steering. please look into this situation and make them to another recall on all the models that  have the power steering assist evidently they all need to be recalledi just got this car 2 months ago.

"i was driving down a city road and lost all control of my vehicle while turning left into traffic. there was a loud mechanical sound as i turned, the steering wheel locked up, warning lights came on in the dash, and neither my brakes nor my steering would engage. the brakes kicked back on, but i had to force the wheel through loud popping and cracking and a loss of power steering. the car was towed to a regular mechanic where they found the power steering assist had failed. the power steering assist had just been replaced 7 months prior due to a recall, because of this same problem (campaign 143). when the mechanic called and asked the hyundai dealer if there was coverage to replace this part, they said no. i had to pay $900 to the other mechanic for a replacement and the tow and went without a car for almost 2 weeks. the recall placed a defective part in my car, then made me pay to replace it."
"on long trips (generally greater than1 hour) the acc/fcw (adaptive cruise control/front collision warning system) system fails intermittantly (with or without the cruise actually being active) and the dash displays ""acc/fcw unavailable service required"".  once having failed, the system cannot be reset while continuing to drive, but turning the engine off and restarting will reset it.  losing these system presents a safety hazard as the fcw is not only a warning system but can actually stop the car in an emergency setting.  losing the acc (adaptive cruise control) actually means losing all cruise control, which is not only annoying but can easily lead to exceeding speed limits and/or constantly checking the speedometer setting resulting in reduced driver situational awareness.  the biggest problem is that the failure throws no codes that code readers at autozone or chrysler can see and chrysler service says there is no fix without a code.  inability to diagnose and fix this important enhanced safety system is a safety failure at chrysler.  note that the failure has occurred in a variety of situations--day/night/sun/rain/cloud/snow/dirty/clean/fast/slow."

"collision avoidance system (presafe plus) failed to warn (as advertised by mbusa) of an imminent rear end collision on an expressway.  the system is supposed to provide an audible warning signal based on the rate of change of the closing distance between mb and a vehicle in front.  moreover, if the driver ignores the warning signal, the mb is supposed to apply brakes automatically.  neither of these two events took place, resulting in a rear end collision. the highway before and at the point of collision was straight with no curves.  after collision damage repair by an mb dealership and assurance from the dealer that the safety systems were operational, i tested the vehicle multiple times by driving the mb into a variety of large boxes the fronts of which were covered with metallic foil.  all tests failed to provide both an audible warning as well as automatic braking  (see  www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_d9a_axav4 for one example of test).   mbusa advertising in 2015 touted these safety features on tv and youtube videos.  what was missing from these infomercials is information on the reliability of these ""safety"" systems (i.e., what is the probability that the system will function as advertised).   i suspect that this probability is quite low, and if so, this fact should have been provided to the consumer.  also, if my experience with the actual accident and my additional testing is any indication of reliability, merc3des benz vehicles incorporating presafe plus should be subjected to a nhtsa recall.

"the dash on my car reads 'power steering assist fault.' the recall is for 'epas steering efforts' this recall was performed once on my car already back in 2015, however the dealership only reprogram the module. they never the defective parts, which means they only half did the job. now my car actually has power steering failure and the same error is coming up on the dash. i reached out to the dealership and they told me that i would be responsible for the cost and that the repair is out of warranty and the recall is closed. so i called the hoe office who said e they would look into it. now after a day i have been informed that the home office will not enforce the recall to make the dealership fix it correctly. i know that the epas recall covers many parts in the power steering. i feel like it should have been fixed right the first time. and that they are just trying to get out of responsibility. attached is the response from the home office of ford."

the vehicle does this 100% of the time.  when on the adaptive cruise control on the interstate there are occasions where the cruise will go 14 mph above the set limit and the engine is at 4000 rpm or higher.  i typically drive at 65 mph on the interstate; this is causing me to go to over 75 mph while the system is trying to recover back to 65mph.  i also own a 2017 toyota rav4 and drive the same roads; the cruise is 'rock steady'.  it holds at a constant 65mph.
"so, it was -17 degrees the other day in minnesota and we packed our car to leave town. went to start the vehicle and the power steering assist fault light came on. along with service adv. trac failure and terrain management system fault. this is not the first time it has happened, it has happened three or four times. except usually we can shut the car off and then restart it and ""walla"" it works fine. except this time:( (sad face)! i was a little worried about driving it to the ford dealer in order to have it checked out however life goes on (i'm ex military). the wife drove the f350 i drove the explorer. we ""fist bumped"" she wished me luck and we drove 12 miles without killing anyone. yippee . $47.48 later they told me the computer is reading bla bla bla.. dollar signs are going through my head. ($1910.42) is the estimate. hmmm... im thinking maybe there is a recall on this. i found the recall!!! so i thought! my car was a few months to new??? (what the) well, that doesn't make sense or (cents) (it does for ford) i contact the nhtsa and ford to see if there is anything that can be done so i dont have to pay for this out of my pocket. i explained the problem to the ford consumer and told her that we need to drive this car if ford cant resolve the issue. the girl on the other end bless her heart, told me we will just have to drive it the way it is. what??? i don""t think she understood the problem at hand! what if the steering kicks in at 60 miles an hour? (umm not good)!!! im hoping ford reads this blog and understands the problem. please give me strength to drive this car and the reflexes it may take to avoid an accident. thanks for nothing at the moment ford. i do believe in you!!"
"the adaptive cruise control (acc) in my 2017 acadia denali will shut off and even cause the vehicle to break for no reason. this has happened numerous times, even with no other vehicle on the road or obstacles in the road. when it happens the acc will shut off, you will hear two distinct chimes and you will see a message saying, 'adaptive cruise control disengaged'.  after this happens you will not be able to reengage the acc and if you try the vehicle will display a message that says 'temporarily unavailable.' i have had it to the dealership numerous times and they have stated they don't know why it would happen, and cannot do anything unless they can duplicate it.  it happens a lot but the dealership and gmc say there is no problem. the first time this happened it almost caused my wife to wreck, since the acc shut off and applied brakes with no other car on the road, badly startling her, and she thought she had hit something.  i even have a video of the acc showing 'temporarily unavailable' after one occasion it shut off and slowed the vehicle. in this instance there were no car in front of me or on either side, but there was one behind me who i am sure was not happy when the vehicle in front of him braked for no reason. a gmc representative told me i can have all the video i want, but it 'doesn't matter and won't change anything'.   the dealership did do a complete diagnostic on one occasion and found evidence that the acc had shut off, but the code did not say why it shut off. this has happened at different speeds range from 55 to 75 mph.  we have had it happen three times in a 30 minute period and drove for a month without it happening.  this causes an unsafe driving experience and should be fixed or the vehicle replaced.  i have found other people online who have experienced this, but there are not enough of us to warrant gmc doing anything."
"on 10/10/2017 my 2015 impala 2ltz had sudden acceleration, full throttle. no brakes, no emergency brake, the only way i could stop the car was to put it into neutral ( over 90 mph by then). then again on 1/25/2018 the same thing happened again, sudden acceleration, by then i knew i had to put it in neutral to stop. my wife and i were lucky i could maneuver the car around several other vehicles and avoided an accident. both times i was on the freeway at freeway speeds with the adaptive cruise  control engaged."
vehicle has adaptive cruise control to reduce speed by braking when other  vehicles may be struck. unfortunately this models brakes are often applied when the radar detects other traffic which will not be a factor; i.e. a second car has left the interstate and is slowing to stop before turning on a secondary road.  my vehicle will brake regardless whether a third vehicle is cruising a highway speed behind me.  similarly if i am moving with traffic in the center lane and overtaking an 18 wheeler on the right moving 10+ miles slower.  my vehicle will brake to match the speed of the truck regardless of the speed or proximity of vehicles behind me. the manufacturer advises this is my vehicles design and no fix or modification is needed.  this has been an issue reported to multiple dealers since about 5000 miles.   hi how
"this vehicle is at 48800 miles and i started to receive the following warnings/errors on my dashboard when the problems began: ""hill hold assist not available"", ""service advancetrack"", abs fault and airbag failure sign lights remain while i was driving the car. after these warnings i lost power steering assist and pulled over and restarted the car. however the warning signs did not clear and i lost abs, traction control and airbags. i have contacted with a ford dealer to diagnose the problem. error codes they got from the car were c0031 and u0401. the first one is related to a short wire in the abs wheel speed sensor at the driver side front wheel and this part was replaced at the dealer. however, after replacement all the mentioned warnings/errors remain and u0401 code remained.  dealer does not know whether these are just from communication error from the computer or these parts are actually defective. i am not able to use the car right now.  in any case, all of the affected systems are not related with drivers driving habits, storage conditions and other things related to the usage of the car and seems like a manufacturing problem, even if it is a communication error or wiring problem. and the affected  components are vital so if there is a production error, this should be resolved as soon as possible."

my wife was driving with my two children. she made a right hand turn and the power steering went out. she almost ran into a truck that was traveling at approximately 45 mph. thank god that the truck swerved and a accident was avoided. a light came on that said power steering assist fault. after a lot of research i've found this is a common problem in certain ford models. i've talked to ford and they have informed me that this is not a recall. how can something so dangerous and with so many incidents not be there responsibility. it seems as if they could careless about the safety of there customers. $1950.00 later and it is fixed. now i have to worry about it happening again. very disappointed on how ford is handling such a dangerous issue. after further review and talking to multiple qualified mechanics i have come to the conclusion that the electric power steering system is in a place that it should not be. it can not handle the heat from the engine and catalytic converter. the module box was cracked which ultimately caused this issue. why would this crack. it's stationary. there is no reason why ford is not taking full responsibility for this faulty set up that will ultimately ending with a fatality if there already hasn't been.

while i was driving my vehicle the power steering went out suddenly with no warning when i was turning left onto a busy highway. there was an error code of electronic steering assist fault. it suddenly came back on and i was able to turn the vehicle barely avoiding an accident. i found out that this part had been part of a recall by ford and was supposedly fixed. the dealer refused to open the recall even though there were 3 fixes and they only did the first/cheapset one.
i first encountered this problem when my vehicle was stationary. my vehicle was sitting in my driveway and the message 'power steering' came on the dashboard and i had no power steering assist. i immediately looked up the issue and found that there was a recall for my vehicle so i was hopeful about the situation. i called my dealership and was told that there was a supposed 'warranty' for my vehicle and i was out of the mileage & time period for my vehicle. and additionally the recall was never given to my vehicle. it doesn't make any sense to me that there is a specific recall for this model of chevy malibu's and i own one and my car just so happens to not have the recall. i've called chevy customer service and they insist they are not liable for this and it will be an out of pocket expense. my power steering has cut out on me on the highway and poses a very dangerous driving experience. i would like to settle this before an accident occurs. the photo that i've listed below is an invoice from the dealership when they diagnoased my car and said it would be out of pocket.

"tl* the contact owns a 2008 mercury mariner. while driving 35 mph, the power steering assist failed and caused the steering wheel to seize. the contact was able to drive the vehicle. the dealer (dana ford lincoln, 266 west service road, staten island, ny 10314) stated that the vin was not included in nhtsa campaign number: 14v284000 (steering). the dealer informed the contact to bring the vehicle in for diagnostic testing. the manufacturer was contacted and did not assist. the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. the failure mileage was 72,637."
"i was driving my 2010 ford escape when i all of a sudden lost power steering while turning with no warning. i was able to pull off on the side of the road then my escape began to make a ""dinging"" noise repeatedly after the vehicle was stopped and put in park. the car then showed ""power steering assist fault"" . my escape has not had power steering since this incident. i called the dealership i purchased the escape from and they informed that the power steering assist recall had been satisfied prior to me purchasing it with the reprogram and nothing replaced. i then called ford customer care who confirmed this information and that i would have to pay for the repair myself since the recall was already satisfied with the reprogram. when running a code scanner it comes back as the torque sensor code. i am currently barely able to drive the vehicle without the power steering and unable to afford the $1500-$2000 repair that i was told ""might work"" by the dealership."
"pcm has water damage due to placement under the hood.  when the hood is opened water runs down directly onto the unit and into the wiring.  the repeated water exposure has caused the unit to fault. this water intrusion causes the vehicle to fail to start intermittently. when turning the ignition, the vehicle will fail to engage the starter; however, headlights, radio are functional. intermittently while operating the vehicle, all of the lights on the instrument cluster illuminate and the tachometer and speedometer will stop reading speed and rmps, resetting to zero.  when this occurs it not impair operation of the vehicle.  additionally, the steering torque sensor is failing. intermittently, the vehicle will display ""power steering assist failure"" on the instrument cluster. when this occurs, turning the car on and off repeatedly will temporarily resolve the issue."
power steering assist failed while driving on the freeway in the rain. i've heard of other cars off this model have the same issue do wonder if it's a systemic problem.
"while driving the radio and other interior lights started flashing on and off. now along with that the check engine light is on, the service stabiltrac is on and it will loose steering assist at times. today it started dying when taking off and at intersections.i have spoken to a few diffrent techs and a couple diffrent shops on this matter and nobody has any answers as to what it is they all have said that they have several doing the same thing and can not figure them out."
"tl* the contact owns a 2008 ford escape. while the vehicle was idling at a stop light, the steering wheel shook and the power steering assist fault warning indicator illuminated. the vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic where it was diagnosed that the torque sensor needed to be replaced. the vehicle was not repaired. the contact called packey webb ford at (866) 496-6602 (1815 ogden ave, downers grove, il 60515) and was informed that no recall was associated with the vin. the dealer stated that the manufacturer was notified of the failure and a case was opened, but had closed. the contact referenced nhtsa campaign number: 14v284000 (steering). the approximate failure mileage was 116,000."

"my new pacifica seems to have problems with the forward collision avoidance system.  three times while driving at low speed with no car in front of me the car made a loud alarm and big red letters ""brake!"" appeared on my dash. this occurred at low speed on suburban roads (20-40 mph).   it was startling.  i could not figure out why this was happening.  then i started getting a notice on my dash that would say ""acc/fcw sensor is dirty and needs to be wiped off and that the ""acc/fcw system was disabled"".  i thought at first that this was the problem however, this has continued intermittently even when the sensors are wiped off.  finally, while travelling at high speed on the interstate, we were nearly in a collision only avoided by swerving into the next lane.  although we almost hit the car in front of us, the pacifica had no reaction: no alarm, no ""brake!"" light, no braking, nothing.  i took it into the dealer who said they could not reproduce the problem and therefore could not do anything for me.  i showed them on their own forum that this was a known issue, but to no avail.  i am very concerned about not having the safety features for which i paid.  i am disgusted by the lack of concern from dick hannah chrysler in vancouver wa."
"failure of electric power steering assist. the loss of power steering assist occur unexpectedly when i was driving.  i noticed a heavy steering wheel feel. the electronic power steering (eps) electronic control unit (ecu) sense a discrepancy in the steering input signals and disable the steering power assist. the light turned on. the power steering assist is lost, greater effort  be required for me, while i drive, to steer the vehicle increasing the risk of a crash."
"power steering assistance failure, failed to control the car"
"upon startup, there is a loss to the power steering.  wheel cannot be turned at all.  sometimes there is no error, other times i get error of steering assist malfunction.  owned car for 6 years, purchased brand new. about 60k miles.  have twins with brand new learners permit, with this car to be dedicated for them to drive.  how can this be safe?  multiple message boards show this is a known issue with these vehicles and poor design requires $2k fix. need immediate recall."
"2014 ford escape titanium - while driving the car in dry weather on a clear street, with no external causes (bumps, accidents, quick movements), the car popped up a message that said ""steering assist fault"" and the steering wheel locked up. it was virtually impossible to steer. the vehicle was slowed down and stopped and the engine was turned off. upon restarting the vehicle, the steering assist fault message was no longer visible and steering was normal again. this is a very scary occurrence. had the fault occurred in a situation where steering was necessary it would have almost certainly caused an accident. in researching online, i see this was a recall issue with previous ford escape vehicles as well as other ford vehicles such as the ford explorer."
"power steering electrical rack.i prepared to leave work,check engine light showed issue with electronic steering.two weeks prior to this event,my radio system(loud crackling)failed.with no power steering assist,drove home,two miles.i called ford dealer to have car tower to their shop."
"on february 23,2018, i purchase a new 2017 acura mdx with technology package.  the vehicle had 378 miles when i purchased it.  it had never been titled and was sold as a new vehicle.  upon taking delivery of the vehicle, i noticed that  the vehicle hesitates when shifting gears. when stopped at a traffic light on a flat paved, city street, the vehicle experiences poor acceleration when taking off.  i am pressing the gas pedal down really hard, yet the vehicle is moving very slowly--not equal to the amount of pressure i am applying to the gas pedal. the acceleration is very poor, especially when pulling off from a stopped position.  when i am going downhill on a paved city street, the vehicle accelerates even when no gas is applied. experiencing rough shifting, especially in low gears on all paved roads. dangerous when trying to merge onto the highway due to extremely slow acceleration.  sometimes when slowing down to stop, the vehicle accelerates. when i try to make a left turn against oncoming traffic, the vehicle hesitates and could cause a serious accident.   all driving takes places on city streets, highways and paved roadways.  on one occasion, the vehicle would not shift into reverse from a parked position. i received an error code saying 'transmission problem, pull over when safe.""   the poor acceleration problem is worse when i enable the adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist features. i have returned the vehicle to the dealership on 2 separate occasions.  each time they tell me the vehicle is operating as designed.  they even said that i need to drive the vehicle more so that the transmission will learn my driving patterns and make the necessary adjustments."
"at 73,000 miles error code in dash read steering assist malfunction service needed. it is very difficult to steer my car. at 76,000 miles error code read engine too hot, stop safely and wait 8 minutes. car shudders and high revs at low speeds and very loud engine noise. i hope that ford recalls these issues soon!!!"
"tl* the contact owns a 2015 ford fusion. the contact stated that the vehicle would veer to the left and there was a loss of power steering ability. the steering assist fault, battery, traction control, and stabilitrak warning indicators illuminated. the vehicle was towed to tri lakes ford (180 state hwy t, branson, mo) where it was diagnosed that the steering gear was defective and needed to be replaced. the manufacturer stated that the vehicle was included in nhtsa campaign number: 18v167000 (steering). the failure mileage was approximately 96,000. ford recall number: 15s14, ford recall number: 18s08. nhsta recall bulletin:15v250000. nhsta recall bulletin: 18v167000"
"i started up the car and started backing out of a parking space.  could not turn the steering wheel and an error message popped up on the dashboard ""steering assist fault service required.  on a 2013 ford escape with 90k on it.  i was able to to get it towed to a garage and they are replacing my steering column for $1800.  my 1967 mustang with no power steering was easier to turn than this car.  luckily we were in a safe spot."
electronic power steering assist is out
"sel premium trim    lane assist malfunction - system will inaccurately detect lane lines and attempt to adjust the vehicle to the center of the lane, even when it already is centered in the lane, resulting in the vehicle pulling into the adjacent lane. has nearly pulled the vehicle into adjacent lane with another vehicle present in the lane resulting in near collisions on numerous occasions. system will also register as the vehicle somehow departing into the lanes on both sides of vehicle at the same time, and will essentially lock the steering wheel in place. see included photo evidence - both lines on the side of the vehicle are solid white indicating that the departure mitigation is activated, and the green ""lane"" icon indicates that the lane departure system is currently activated. dealer service department response: """"npf unable to reproduce customers concern""."
"loss of steering. ""power steering assist fault"" this is a known issue and documented issue and ford is 'selectively' choosing to cherry-pick coverage on recall. this needs to be covered on all effected vehicles not cherry picked! i should not have to pay 2-$3,000 + for a repair that's been well documented"
"our 2014 honda accord (purchased ""certified pre-owned"") has an intermittent issue. first of all the car has 53,000 miles. have already had to replace the battery; since replacing the battery, a myriad of lights come and go on the dash for approximately 1 month. now the lights are staying on - brake, abs, fcw, ldw, steering assist. dealer says ""probably"" the abs module ($1400). launched a complaint about this issue with honda america - they tell me to take it in and have it checked. my question(s) were (a) by spending $1400, is this going to fix it or will it ""probably"" fix it. (b) how long before it happens again?-  keep in mind the first one lasted 53,000 miles (c) how dangerous is this? no answers to any of these questions were answered; the only thing that was clear was that it wasn't a widespread issue because the nhsta or honda hadn't issued any kind of tsb or recall. i thought it was somewhat telling when i called another dealership, spoke with the desk person in service. while over the phone, explained the lights that were on - the answer of ""it's the abs module"" was instant. for something that isn't ""common"" or widespread, this was a very quick reply. also a google search turns up other issues just like the one we are having. just wonder how safe this is?"
"three times during the first 1500 miles the collision mitigation braking system has failed, disabling that feature and adaptive cruise control, displaying a large diagnostic on the electronic dashboard and telling me to see my dealer. in all cases i was driving in normal traffic on northern california freeways at cruising speed (twice on 101, once on 80). the first two failures occurred during daytime, the third at night. the weather in all cases was normal (no rain, snow, mud, ...) .when i visited the dealer after the first two occurrences (when the car is turned off and then back on the condition clears) the dealer found no diagnostic codes or other problems. then the problem occurred a third time. the dealer and honda corporate say they have no idea how to fix it because of the absence of diagnostic codes."
"tl* the contact owns a 2012 ford fusion. while driving approximately 45 mph, the ""power steering assist fault"" and ""service advance track"" warning messages displayed and the power steering suddenly malfunctioned. the steering wheel became difficult to turn. the failure was not diagnosed or repaired. the manufacturer and local dealer (brookland ford in brookland, mi) were notified of the failure, but no assistance was offered. the failure mileage was 97,000. "
the automatic steering wheel tilt sometimes gets locked in the lowest down position.  at that point the steering wheel can only be adjusted front to back and not up and down.
"adaptive cruise control causes the car to down-shift unnecessarily on a straight downhill grade and sometimes increases the speed by as much as 8-10 mph.   i feel out of control, which is dangerous.  a toyota technician has confirmed the same behavior on another 2017 corolla.    on one occasion, on a freeway downhill where the speed could have easily been controlled by letting off the gas, the car downshifted to d3, revs went to about 4000, and the speed increased to 70mph - when it was set to about 62.  on another occasion, on a relatively flat, straight freeway road, it again downshifted for no apparent reason, and the speed again increased over the set speed (of course the revs were higher again).  in both of the above cases, there was no car or other obstacle in front of me that should cause the car to slow down.  i've seen the adaptive cruise respond to a car too close so know how that feels."
"toyota's pre collision sensor is unreliable and intermittently produces an error ""pcs sensor unavailable -- clean sensor"". the safety portion of this complaint comes when dynamic cruise control is set. when the sensor no longer detects a vehicle in front of you, and there is clearly there, the vehicle will accelerate at a high rate of speed before the error shows on the dash cluster if the cruise control is set above the traffic flow. i expect and realize that this situation could occur, and i avoid using the system. however, if somebody not familiar with this fault is using the pcs sensor and does not realize this problem, they will end up rear ending another vehicle, possibly at a high rate of speed before the system shuts itself off and lets off the throttle. i know i am not the only person dealing with this issue. several others on different forums have described similar situations where accidents have been narrowly avoided because of this fault. the local toyota dealership has been helpful in resolving this issue and have pulled codes for a forward camera communication issue. a new camera has been ordered and will be installed next week."
"power steering assist failure ! this needs to be addressed before people are killed because of this problem ! this problem comes and goes and creates a very unsafe situation , you never know when it will happen !"
"pcs (pre collision system) and pedestrian detection system do not function as advertised by the manufacture and assured by the dealer. there is no indication or any evidence that such a system exists in the car. therefore, it gives you a false sense of security."
"when car is parked and i start the engine the dashboard shows ""steering assist fault"" error message appears. when the attempt to drive the steering wheel  will be very difficult to turn to the right or to the left or will  lock. this issue makes it very difficult to make turns in an intersections, highways and city streets. problem will continues until car is turn off. when the car is started up again, the message error will appear on the dashboard and the steering wheel problem will continue."
"power steering assist fault occurred without warning while driving on city streets. i was still able to drive but required a lot of force. 94,000 miles. initially, restarting the car fixed the problem, but this only helped a few times."
"electronic power steering assist stopped working while i was at a stop light, the steering wheel explanation mark light appeared to illuminate. at that moment i was unable to steer both right and left but by some miracle i managed to get back home by using all my strength to turn. i took it to the dealership, they first made replace the battery claiming that the car is showing low voltage and that not enough juice is flowing to the eps system causing it not to work, when that didn't fix the issue, they recommended me to replace the control unit, when that didn't fix the issue, they recommended to replace the motor on the rack. at this moment i called honda and made them aware of the situation and they said they could not help. and now i am writing this incident to spread awareness on this issue. my car has 66,000 miles on it and has been always been well maintained. power steering to start causing issues this soon is really sad, and for honda not to do anything about it knowing it is a major safety issue is highly unacceptable. i am disappointed in honda for putting their customers lives in danger."
car became extremely hard to steer at less than 5 mph; power steering assist fault message noted.
"the automatic emergency braking system incorrectly activated under a false-positive situation resulting in the brakes being applied while crossing over a bridge. luckily, there wasn't a vehicle following me, or else there may have been a collision."
"lane assist has jerked car towards oncoming traffic on several occassions, making it a useless and dangerous feature. adverse weather and inadequate road lines/markings exasperate the issue, but i have had instances where neither of these conditions were present and lane assist still jerked the car into oncoming traffic. in order to avoid an accident while using this feature, one must keep ahold of the steering wheel much stronger than what is typical, otherwise it will pull out of your hand. when it has occurred, i had to actively fight against the pull. this has occurred on city streets as well as on the highway. i keep this feature turned off due to the risk that it poses while left on."
the engine shut completely off during driving. i lost power steering and automatic braking.  i tried to restart but it would not turn over. the battery and the alternator were not dead. i had it towed to a shop and they said the engine control module was dead. it almost caused me to have an accident. i then had to have it towed to a dealer for repair.
sudden total loss loss of electric power steering assist while driving on the interstate.  sudden total loss loss of stability control system while driving on the interstate.
power steering fails completely. locking which prevents steering. get the following message:  power steering assist fault.  occurred when i started car. turned engine off/on. this cleared the failure. note; tire air pressure is not low.  i understand that 2011 & 2012 model years have been recalled for this problem. please note this is a $1400 repair at ford.  ford service instructed me not to drive this car as it isn't safe.
"tl* the contact owns a 2010 ford fusion. the contact stated that while reversing, the steering wheel seized as the power steering assist light illuminated. the contact contacted the dealer pegues-hurst ford dealer (903-758-6211, 200 tx-63 spur longview, tx 75601) and was told to bring the vehicle to the shop for diagnostic test. the vehicle was not taken to the dealer for diagnosis or repairs. the manufacturer was not made aware of the failure. the failure mileage was 150,000."
"i had to have the electronic steering assist replaced in my ford escape due to the power steering going out. the vehicle was not in motion when it went out. a few months later i learned that there was a recall for ""certain"" make and model escapes. obviously, my vehicle should have been included."
"my ford focus st 2013 suddenly failed and showed the message ""steering assist fault service required"". steering wheel got very heavy and not possible to drive the car to the dealer. there were not previous warnings, a noise or feeling of it was not working correctly, it just happened from night to morning when parked in my garage. i m located in mexico but this info may help and i m willing to help."
the power steering assist fault message appeared in the odometer display. this could not be reset by turning off the ignition for 10 seconds and turning on the ignition again. this message has been intermittent for 6 months. it would appear often with first start up on rainy and rainy on cold days. never occurred while driving. i drove the car to a local repair shop. the steering takes a great effort to turn the wheel. had a near miss accident with wood trash on the highway. the repair shop said this could be covered by an extended recall. the ford dealers we called said their system was down not able to check vin for recall. it has about 83000 miles and 6 years old. the steering failure is a significant safety defect. i've driven cars before without power steering - easy compared to this fail. this failure is extremely unsettling feeling when trying to make a curve or turn. check back later to see if ford repaired this.
"at approximately 9am on the morning of 1/4/18, i was driving in autopilot on the 405 heading north to my office in santa monica in my tesla model s and the car simply ran into the barrier wall on the left side of the car pool lane at 75mph. it was absolutely crazy! i have contacted tesla about the accident several times, but they are simply not interested. i just read about an accident that the  u.s. national transportation safety board is investigating where the same thing happened and the driver died. i believe my accident could have ended the same way and i think it needs to be taken very seriously."
"tl* the contact owns a 2016 tesla model s. the contact stated that while driving at 75 mph, the auto pilot engaged on its own and the contact was unable to turn it off. as a result, the contact crashed into a barrier wall as he was able to place the vehicle back into manuel mode. the air bags failed to deploy. the contact did not sustained any injuries. a police report was not filed. the vehicle was not towed. the vehicle was taken to an independent mechanic, but was not diagnosed or repaired. the dealer was not contacted. the manufacturer was notified of the failure. the failure mileage was 15,000. "
"power steering assist seemed intermittent.  the power steering lower shaft at the universal joint has become corroded making steering difficult (to overcome the corrosion) as well as dangerous when further corrosion leads to steering failure.  many on-line forums make note of this problem. it appears to be a systematic design flaw that can lead to dangerous consequences.  imagine losing steering control at high speed.  since toyota is addressing frame rust for the same year, with either a replacement frame or a protective coating, why isn't this of equal concern on some kind of recall.  it looks like i've addressed the issue with a $600 repair to protect my safety, however as this is a known problem, why is it not a voluntary or mandatory recall to address this dangerous condition.  this condition started the day after the truck was returned to me after getting the frame undercoating.  this condition happens at any speed, left or right turns, when cold or warmed up.  it is most notable when cold at slow speed (first started up, turning around in the driveway)."
"purchased acura mdx in january of 2018 so it is now 3 months. i believe there is something significantly wrong with its automatic braking system. i was driving down a hill on a residental, fast paced road, with a guardrail to my right side and another car passing me on the left side. we both we traveling at the speed limit of 40 miles per hour when all of a sudden my car's brakes went on, causing me to swerve into the guardrail. from there, i was thrown into oncoming traffic causing a collison. i believe the system became confused and stepped on the brakes when it detected the other vehicle accelerating towards me."
"i was driving around a curve when suddenly lost all power steering. i was able to slow the vehicle before going off of the colvert on the opposite side of the road. i was fortunate that there wasn't any oncoming traffic in the other lane and that i could slow down to prevent vehicle damage. this sudden loss of power steering assist is very dangerous! it may not sound that bad just losing power steering but when you do not expect it and it happens it is very dangerous, especially around curves or at the stop light making a right and tight turn. i am a young man that can control non power steering vehicles but not unexpectedly!"
"my wife and i leased a 2018 ford explorer platinum last saturday. we wanted to upgrade to the latest technology.     i failed to ask specifically if the adaptive cruise went to zero mph for stop and go traffic. the window sticker said it had ""adaptive cruise control"". i have had two cars with adaptive cruise and they have both worked down to zero mph.  during our first drive using the so-called ""adaptive cruise"", we were following a car on the freeway going 70mph. rather suddenly, that car slowed. our ford was slowing down beautifully; you could feel and see the effects of the automatic braking.  then, suddenly and without noticable warning to us, the braking quit and our car was coasting towards the car in front.  we narrowly missed a low speed rear-end collision. i would call this cruise control a ""partial"" adaptive cruise control.  i really feel this aspect of the adaptive cruise  should be more prominent in all of the literature as well as on the window sticker..  i cannot imagine what would have happened had the deceleration been extremely fast from 70mph and our cruise control disengaged and the braking suddenly quit!  this is very dangerous when you are used to a car that will continue braking all the way to a stop.  i do considerable rush hour driving and am in stop and go traffic constantly.  other car manufacturers are able to build cars with a cruise that goes down to zero.  why not ford?  i would even hope that a software/firmware update could make my car cruise go down to zero.  that would be such a great safety update to offer customers. i believe standards should require zero mph capability from adaptive cruise controls and would hope ford could be made to fix this rather dangerous device. any manufacturer using such a partial adaptive cruise system should be made to note that prominently on the window sticker and in the literature."
there is no power steering. power steering assist fault comes up on the dash. there was a recall on this in 2014.
electric power steering assist stopped working. it rebooted when we turned the engine off and restarted. but it went out again and restarted when turning it back on. i called the dealer and they informed me that the recall ended in 2016. i never received a recall notice to have it fixed. i feel that gm should take responsibility for this hazard. my wife was terrified when it stopped working at 45 miles per hour with no warning.
"steering assist failure notice appeared on and off for nearly a year. notice would disappear after turning vehicle off and straightening steering wheel. at 77000 miles, warning came on again and would not clear. this is a serious safety hazard especially if it happens while driving on the road. i was lucky it was just in my driveway.  ford has recalled several cars of similar make and model for this same issue yet have not recalled the ford focus. this is a serious safety hazard especially if it happens while driving on the road. ford needs to own up to their mistake and send a recall and fix the problem on all vehicles. i should not have to pay for a manufacturing defect. the car is now out of commission because i can't afford the repair and i am to scared to drive it as is."
"i purchased a new 2017 honda cr-v on 1/19/18 and on 1/29/18 the car started beeping and the following error messages appeared while i was driving on city streets: adaptive cruise control problem, collision mitigation system problem, road departure system problem, and brake system. the brakes felt less responsive and squishy. on 1/29/18 i contacted superstition springs honda (where i purchased the car) immediately. they updated and reset the radar system but that didn't help. i left my car 2 days so they could replace the radar and the car worked fine until 3/31/18 when again it beeped, the messages appeared again, and the brakes felt less responsive again. i'll take the car back again tomorrow (closed today for easter) but i'm very concerned this will be a continued problem on a car that i've had less than 3 months."
when i started my car the steering wheel was hard to turn. i got a warning on the dash that said steering assist fault. this is crazy! the car only has 63000 miles on it. please have ford include these focus cars in the safety recall also. this failure while driving could kill people.
ford has not fixed the issue!  vehicle was taken in do you do recall my previous owner and only software was updated pertaining to the power steering recall. it is not a software update issue. the torque sensor must be replaced. ford will not cover nor reimburse this issue. many other customers are having this exact same problem. the power steering assist goes out without warning and makes the vehicle very dangerous to drive. i was driving my vehicle this morning and out of nowhere the turning became very difficult.  *tr
"while accelerating and switching lanes on the interstate around 70mph the car reduced power and then downshifted and revved up to over 4k rpms. the car would not accelerate with foot all the way into it and reduced speed to 50mph.   emissions system error, transmission problem error, sh awd error and blind spot assist error were all illuminated."
"i state that tesla new about tesla enhanced autopilot system malfunctioning long time ago but did not do anything to prevent accidents.   monday, september 5, 2017 at 2:27-2:28 pm my tesla enhanced autopilot system malfunctioned. i was driving on left lane of a straight part of i-280 north without any turns at that moment, with clear view and no vehicle in front of my car. after using autopilot for 20 min my car suddenly moved left and then immediately moved to the right. i was holding hands on the wheel and took wheel control. in 2 minutes after restarting autopilot, my car moved suddenly left and then right, moving to the right lane.  i took control quickly, but the only reason the accident was avoided because the driver of suv on the next lane. he hit the brakes and changed lanes to escape the accident.     i reported to tesla service requesting a full investigation and uninstall autopilot system from my car.  my car was in their service   for a month.  finally, they did not denied that my car had changed lines on autopilots system without warning but stated that the 'car had worked as designed '.    i requested a computer log for my car but was told that i could get it only though a court order. i received my car back and never used autopilot system again.   i am a doctor and feel that i am obligated to report tesla to you to safe somebody life and to prevent new tragedy.

"i have had this 2014 ford focus since early 2015. i have had problems out of this car since i have had it, with the dealership not ever finding out what was wrong. it started with power train issues which they had issued a recall for and i had brought to them and the dealership still did not fix. the last two weeks the car has begun having steering issues. while i was driving it just locked up and i had to coast to a stop and restart it. it drove fine after it sat for a minute and i restarted it, then three days later would not turn again after i started the vehicle while parked in my driveway and was getting ready to drop my children off at school and then head to work myself. i once again had to turn the vehicle of and let it sit for a minute and had to restart it. it ran okay for another three days. this morning it once again while parked in my driveway will not turn and the steering assist light came on the car. this time it will not turn at all after i have restarted the car several times."
"i was in heavy traffic on i-17 north of phoenix az.  adaptive cruise control (acc) was set and i was following the car ahead at the maximum distance set by acc.  my foot was not on the accelerator or the brake.      i saw the preceding car's brake lights come on, and i felt my car start to slow.  the preceding car stopped and it became apparent that my car was no longer braking, or if it was, not hard enough to stop.  i applied the brakes but it was too late and we hit the car in front of us at a speed great enough to do $7000 of damage to the front of my car.  curiously the air bags did not deploy.    passengers in the car included my wife in the front seat, who was thrown into the seat/shoulder harness hard enough to knock the wind out of her.  she complained of chest pains and was taken by ambulance to the hospital. no serious injuries were found.  my daughter in the back seat and i were restrained properly by the seat belt and sustained no injuries.    i contacted subaru and told them about the accident.  they responded by telling me that they were sending two engineers to inspect my vehicle.  after a month or 6 weeks they responded that their investigation was complete.  they found that 5 seconds before the crash i was traveling at 45 mph.  1.5 seconds before the crash the brakes were applied (disabling acc).  they told me that the eyesight was functioning normally and will not stop all crashes.  so sorry.    i believe there is something wrong, either with the design or the functioning of eyesight and acc.  my car had 60,000 miles on the odometer at the time of the crash.  i have used acc hundreds (perhaps thousands) of times in heavy traffic.  it had always performed as advertised, i.e.  maintaining a constant distance between me and the car ahead.  it slowed as needed, and came to a stop whenever traffic stopped.  then one day it didn't "

on april 7th 2018 i started my 2012 ford focus and the steering wheel was locked solid the warning lights lite up stating electronic power steering assist failure. i turned the vehicle off and restarted it 3 times until it started working again. i went right to the dealer where i bought the vehicle. they claim there is no recall. i did some research find that there's been over 120 injuries and one death related to the power steering failure on these vehicles. this is happened to my vehicle now totaling 10 times and now i'm terrified to drive the vehicle which concerns of as i'm on the road the steering locks up when i get in a crash or accident. the nhtsa and ford know of this problem. this is a major issue that must be addressed.  please help  i was stationary it's time and just hoping and praying this doesn't happen to me when i'm on the highway at 70 miles an hour like it has done to other people and have been injured.
"multiple incidents have occurred where adaptive cruise control applies hard deceleration to the vehicle while at highway speeds without warning or without an object in front of the vehicle. approx travel speed has been 65mph and vehicle collision warning comes on and instantly brakes causing a 10mph or more deceleration. it has happened on curves or when driving near a truck. recent incident was moving from right lane to the left lane of a highway to pass a truck and another vehicle was following mine. as i approached the tractor portion of the tractor/trailer, my truck braked hard and the vehicle behind me nearly crashed into the back of my vehicle. the other driver wasn't expecting me to brake while passing another vehicle to its left. this has happened multiple times. i have contacted ford and they admitted that there is a problem with the adaptive cruise system and that it was a safety issue but they had no plans to fix/recall the issue. question - how many rear impact accidents/incidents/potential incidents will it take for ford to address this serious unannounced braking issue. it is very unnerving to be driving at highway speed and then to be thrown forward for no reason because your vehicle brakes. ford did acknowledge that this is a problem and yet does not wish to address it likely until there is death to lawsuit after which it will have been too late for someone. please exert whatever pressure you can to get verification from ford and have them address this problem with a recall before someone is killed. thank you.     highway speed  adaptive cruise control on  on curves or straight roads  near a tractor trailer   collision warning/braking/rapid deceleration  nearly causing multiple rear end accidents - many incidents  ford verified but refuses to fix"

i lose power steering assist when i'm driving. usually happens when the car is parked or randomly while i am driving.
"this car has serious issues. the previous braking complaint is absolutely valid!    the first two issues outlined below are most problematic at highway speed with the adaptive cruise control set. that being said, problem number one in particular occurs on a regular basis whenever the cruise control is set.   1. braking - the adaptive cruise control will sense large vehicles in adjacent lanes and abruptly apply brakes. it seems the mdx 'thinks' these vehicles are in your lane when they are in fact in the lane next to you. the same will occur when a car in an adjacent lane drifts near, but not into the lane occupied by the mdx. we have had no less than three near misses where the vehicle behind us nearly rear ended us due to the immediate and unnecessary application of brakes by the mdx.   2. lane keep assist - on a multiple occasions we have attempted to maneuver the vehicle while remaining in our lane to avoid a road hazard. the car fights against you with such force as to nearly make the vehicle non-maneuverable.  both of  the items above have been reported to the dealer twice. in both cases we were told this is normal and that we should adjust the sensor sensitivity. we've tried all levels of the sensor sensitivity and nothing has worked.   3. unintended acceleration - this is easily the most scary thing that has occurred. while slowly driving through a grocery store parking lot, my foot was hovering over the brake. our mdx all of a sudden with no driver input automatically accelerated abruptly. i immediately hit the brakes and the vehicle responded. thankfully, no pedestrian was crossing in front of me. i've yet to see this problem again however this causes serious concern."
"was driving normally when abs, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, automatic emergency breaking, and breaking system ""problem"" lights lit up all at once. limped the car home."
"i was driving to work last friday and i suddenly heard the alert signal and dashboard light and then i couldn't turn the steering wheel. the error message on the dash said ""steering assist fault service required"".  i was able to turn the wheel enough to get it off the road. luckily i was only going about 35 mph on the highway. the power steering had failed as i was driving down the highway. there were many other cars around me, but luckily they avoided me. i have one repair quote for $2000 to repair the entire power steering rack and pinion system, of which we cannot pay. we took it to 2 other mechanics who reported that they were unable to fix it because it was an electric system and had to be reprogrammed by the dealership service dept. from my research, this is the same issue ford had with their 2008-2011 ford explorers."
"while driving the steering wheel started shaking. within 48hrs i lost power steering and was unable to drive safely. i had to have the car towed to my home because it went out while picking up my kids from school. a mechanic gave me the diagnosis of error b2278. the same code identified for recall 14s05 in replacing the torque sensor. ford did not resolve the issue properly when my vehicle was serviced for the recall. a software update was done instead of replacing the faulty sensor, which ford identified as the source of failed steering assistance. i was without a car for 2 weeks because it was not safe to drive. ford did not honor the recall to replace the sensor."
my electronic power steering assist is not working.  at a stop or lower speeds it is nearly impossible to turn the steering wheel.  at higher speeds the steering wheel is still very difficult to turn or control.  there have been several instances where the truck is very difficult to control and is extremely dangerous.

"the power steering assist totally cut out without warning in the middle of a turn out from a parking lot on to a 6-lane highway. i was not able to complete the turn. the truck shuddered very roughly as the power steering failed. luckily there were no other cars on the road at the time. if there were, one would have hit me and it would have been bad.  i turned the a/c off and my power steering came back. it has not happened again yet. but i am very concerned that it will happen again. i hope that this report, if supported by many more from other owners, may point to a larger problem, if one exists."
"since we leased this car last year in april, we have had many issues with the pre-sense prematurely going off in the late setting ( automatic braking system to prevent rear collisions.     there have many times where my wife was backing out of our driveway and even in the late setting it picked up vehicles from the opposite lane and abruptly slammed on the brakes, scaring my wife.     one of these times when it did this, it came extremely close to where by the time she was able to gain control , engaging it in drive she was almost hit in the back of the car until she could accelerate to the speed limit of the road we live on which is 35 mph. there has been other times, like backing up in our driveway and it just decides to go off with no vehicles in the the driveway???    i have had the dealer look at this twice and have been in conversations with audi corporate. their last comment to me is the system is working as designed.     this is my 20+ audi and currently have one other 2018 audi and 2018 vw. last year alone i had 4 audi's so i am familiar with the product, this is working properly and is a safety issue which concerns me that could cause my wife to be in an accident because of the premature engagement.     i want to mention that my wife is now inconvenienced having to back into our driveway thus preventing it to go off when leaving for work every day. since we live on a scenic byway, there is a steady flow of cars but again at a slower speed of 35 mph. lastly this system is set to late warning but can not be turned off permanently or we would.    i have sent many emails to audi , spoken with the dealer and the executive assistant. there are other complaints online with people having issues with the new pre-sense system."
"the ""power steering assist fault"" light came on and i loss the power steering ability as i was driving down the street. good thing i was on a city street and not going fast. i was told that there were no open recalls on this, but in 2014 there was a recall, but to update the software only unless the power steering had actually gone out.  i want to know how did updating the software fixes the issue?  i was forced to take it to a dealership, and was told there were no open recalls, and that it will be about $1,800 to fix. why is ford not issuing another recall to take care of the numerous complaints for this failure?  it's so unfair that this was going to be a problem eventually, and ford slapped a band-aid on it so as to not take responsibility for their error.  i guess if someone gets injured seriously enough, then maybe they'll do something.  unfortunately, i have to pay for my car to be fixed, but i am going to do all that i can to get someone to listen to my concerns regarding the so call ""recall"" that didn't fix anything. never again will i buy a ford vehicle."

"while in the driveway and stationary, i turned on the car and the ""power steering assist"" warning light came on.  the power steering was not operable and the steering went into manual making it almost impossible to turn the wheel.  after the mechanic evaluated this, it was determined the sensor needs to be replaced.  the part alone is $1100 and that does not include labor. rather costly.  there are many, many complaints found about this specific issue with a simple google search.  other ford cars have received a recall on this part.  it seems particularly odd and extremely irresponsible on ford's behalf to not concede to the defect on this particular year/make/model and issue a recall for replacement at no cost to the consumer."
"i was driving in the #1 lane in moderate traffic on the freeway, going about 40 mph, moving straight ahead, and slightly accelerating. an alert showed up on my dash screen stating that there was an issue with steering assist. as i pulled off the freeway, i noticed that it was significantly more difficult to turn my steering wheel, and as i took a right turn at the freeway exit, it was almost impossible to turn. i had the vehicle towed to a mechanic who recommended that i have it taken to the dealership, as he believed it fell under the same steering issue that many other ford models have lately been recalled for. the dealership confirmed that the steering gear will need to be replaced, at full cost to me because the focus does not fall under these recalls. ford must issue a recall for the focus models in addition to those that have already been recalled. i am not the only focus owner to experience this terrifying issue, which could have easily caused an accident had my steering assist gone out in a slightly different situation. this is a life threatening fault and focus owners need to be aware that the vehicles they are driving are dangerous."

"the anti-collision automatic braking system incorrectly engaged when approaching a flat metal plate in the parking lot of a shopping center. the vehicle was moving at approx. 5-10 mph when it suddenly started beeping, and flashing the ""brake"" warning alert on the driver's dashboard console. i was driving and, not seeing any people or approaching vehicles or anything else ahead of me, didn't know why the automatic braking was flashing a warning. before i had a chance to ""gently"" brake to see what the situation was, suddenly the automatic braking system ""violently"" engaged, bringing the vehicle to an immediate stop just before the metal plate. please see the attached photograph of the metal plate that i took several minutes later. the brakes did not engage when going back over the plate in the opposite direction, or when attempting to duplicate the incident.    the incident happened on march 25, 2018 at approximately 4:45 pm arizona time.    i called the honda dealer the next day to report the incident. no service manager was available to speak with me, and the receptionist said that she would leave a message with one of them. i have yet to be called back, 4 weeks later. i want the honda dealer to read the codes from the onboard computer system(s) to 1) verify that the automatic braking system engaged, and 2) see if there is any supporting data for why the system incorrectly engaged.    more importantly, i want to report this incident to the nhtsa. doing an internet search turned up several other public reports on websites of similar incidents. a false positive for an impending collision was determined by the vehicle's ""smart system"" algorithms, which then triggered a physical reaction (automatic involuntary braking). fortunately the vehicle was moving at only 5-10 mph, rather than 45 mph on a city road or 65 mph on a highway."

( so i was backing out of my garage to the driveway- less than 10 miles /hour) dealership said this was a common problem and there had been some kind of extension on the warranty but mine was not covered b/c it was too old or too many miles. i had to spend over $1300 to repair this.  i called ford motor company to complain and try to get an explanation as to why if something like this was already a problem why would the not cover it. they said they did have a recall and i had taken my vehicle in in august of 2015 for the fix so the said it had been more than a year  from that date and now not covered again. however, since this is the same problem that they fixed before, i feel there is still and issue with the steering out there since it was the same part that went bad and is a very dangerous thing to go bad in such a short period of time. ford stated that this would be reported and to save my receipt."
"i was driving on heavily-congested i-66 eastbound in the dc metro area (northern virginia) at 70mph. my vehicle alerts me with chime, so i look down at the communication center. i see an alert that says: service power steering assist. i decrease my speed and safely pull over to the right shoulder. i turn off my vehicle to see if the issue would reset. i turned it back on, and it did not. i call my husband to alert him of the issue. i safely reentered the highway, and it took all my might to get my vehicle back on the road. i arrived at work and could barely steer to park my vehicle.     i called my dealer to let them know what happened. he looked up my truck by vin and said there was no recall on it; however, there is a recall for the same issue on other vehicles identical to mine. apparently, there is an issue with this part on more than the vins that are currently listed, and i would like to get this issue resolved asap.     i am hoping that the same thing with my a/c condenser does not happen: i paid $1,000 and had to wait 3 months to get it fixed because the part was on backorder, and months later, i received a letter in the mail saying that there is an issue with the part and gm would fix it -- well after the fact -- and that same issue affected so many people.    i will admit, this is the very last gm vehicle i will purchase if i have to come out of pocket for this power steering assist issue. sometimes i wonder if certain personal demographics are tied to these vins after a sale.    recall number  14v719000  recall date  11/10/2014  component  steering:electric power assist system  "

"unintended acceleration of 2018 tesla model 3.    issue description: issue occurred on 05/04/18 at approx. 11:52 am while trying to park the vehicle in a parking lot of a grocery store. the vehicle was in the parking space position when it suddenly accelerated without any input from the driver. the brakes were applied however they felt inoperative. it felt as though the driver had no control over braking and the vehicle had a mind of its own. the driver turned the steering wheel to avoid directly hitting a dumpster while trying to brake. the passenger side of the vehicle then hit a curb and a pony wall. after the impact, the driver was able to turn the vehicle while applying the brakes that eventually brought the vehicle to a stop.      probable cause: unknown. given the vehicle is new, it is difficult to identify a reason why would it accelerate unintentionally. the vehicle is equipped with enhanced auto pilot which was not engaged at the time of incident. the night prior to the incident the vehicle displayed software glitch where in it would not control the volume of the radio while driving with the buttons on the steering wheel and was stuck in controlling the steering wheel position.    car is running software version 8.1 (2018.14.13 9e3b7ff)"

this is a complaint about the tesla autopilot.  here is a recently posted video:  https://youtu.be/flxyhwfvaza    the autopilot drives onto the wrong side of the road!!!    this owner is a tesla enthusiast and presumably keeps up on the latest new about tesla crashes.  despite this he is still under the mistaken impression that it is safe to use autopilot on narrow winding roads and against oncoming traffic.  it is only a matter of time before this man collects his darwin award.  unfortunately he will probably take the lives of innocent road users at the same time.  please pass this information on to the ntsb who are investigating the tesla autopilot crashes.  thank you.  outraged citizen.    
"here is a video that has just been uploaded to youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4guhsmipiq4    this owner thinks it is perfectly safe to jam some fruit in the steering wheel to eliminate the ""hold steering wheel"" nags.    he does not seem to be a complete idiot. the problem is that he has been mislead by the hype spread by tesla and ceo elon musk.  despite several fatal crashes musk is still spreading the message that nhtsa found  autopilot is 40% safer than a human driver. nhtsa has now revealed that the claim was based on tesla's own (unverified) data.    more people will die unless this uncontrolled and highly dangerous experiment is halted immediately.    please do something.  thank you.  deeply concerned citizen."

"this nissan car is equipped with features named, pro-pilot assist (ppa), intelligent cruise control (icc) and emergency brake assist (eba). when engaged, it is supposed to keep lanes and follow distance if there is a car in front. when the car in front is stopped this car is supposed to stop as well.     ppa when engaged, if there are good road markings, will show a green stearing on the dash board, to show that car can steer it self. however if there is a car stopped in front on the same lane (ex. stopped for a red light), this car do not detect that there is a car stopped, and keep going forward until crash into the stopped car, driver have to intevene to stop at this time to stop. i took car to dealer and they said this is normal. that is not what nissan advertise.      this behavior is quite dangerous of these cars, and my expectation is the car need to stop if there is an obstruction in the road, when the green steering wheel on dash is showing that car is doing auto-steer."

"i was driving my vehicle in autopilot mode going 50mph southbound in the left lane on a divided 2 lane highway, route 1 in delaware. it was clear and sunny, no fog. all these conditions are preferred when using autopilot on my vehicle. a white ford f150 perpendicular to my car was between the median in a turnabout to go northbound with its truckbed about 1 foot into my lane. autopilot did not alert me to this car, nor did it slow down or veer in order to avoid it (two features enabled on my vehicle and advertised by tesla). i was unable to grab the wheel in time to avoid the accident. i feel that the autopilot's feature of working without the hands on the wheel lulled me into a false sense of security and i most certainly would not have had this type of accident had i not had autopilot on my vehicle.    i am so thankful i wasn't killed or injured, i feel that the way autopilot is handled is extremely dangerous and should require hands to be on the wheel at all times. i am hopeful something will be done to prevent accidents like this in the future. this system is being downloaded to cars with little to no regulation. i contacted tesla with my concerns with the hope their engineers could use the data from my car for further development, however tesla was immediately defensive about my serious car accident."
"2015 ford fusion 's' (epas) defect.  50,200 miles on odometer at time of occurrence.  vehicle was stationary.  fusion's 2.5l engine (cold) would not start after being at rest for eight hours.  display depicted ""power steering assist fault"" and ""service advance trac"".   vehicle would not start, even with (proper) jump.  all interior and exterior lighting was very bright.  towed to ford dealership.  i was told by service manager that battery was ""going bad"" and told of $2086.00 fix to the epas (alone).  i was not previously having any steering issues or concerns.  notified ford inc.  and was issued a ""cas"" case number and told to look for an email from them in two days with their resolution decision, if any.  i am not optimistic.  vehicle was properly maintained and always garaged.  several of my service visits were at multiple ford dealerships, so maybe that will help my case.  a two thousand dollar repair, on a ""garage kept"" three year old car, with 50k miles, albeit out of 3/36 warranty, is simply not acceptable.  luckily, no one in my family was injured/killed by this defect.  sadly, ford's refusal to acknowledge this problem will obviously cost lives down the road, due to epas failure, not to mention future sales."

"windshield easily cracks - we have had our 2018 outback for less than 6 months and less than 5000 miles and have had 3 windshields develop severe cracking.  the first two were replaced with factory windshields by professional installers.  the slightest impact, the last two being barely perceivable, results in an elongated crack forming.  with four vehicles in our household, we have only had 2 windshields replaced in 14 years since moving to this area so have ruled out bad luck or driving habit.  subaru (both dealer and corporate) have been unresponsive.  the current cracking and star formed after a barely audible impact.  the star grew and is now crumbling in the center with 3 fracture lines extending from it.    first incident - on i-17 while passing a semi approx speed 75 mph  second incident - on az 69 in normal traffic appox speed 45 mph  third incident - on i-17 while following a vehicle using isight dynamic cruise control approx speed 75 mph  first two claims covered by insurance which we attributed to bad luck.  third incident in so few months/miles seems to point to quality/design issue since other vehicles (past and present) have never developed this severe cracking (picture provided) which prompted this complaint."

"while driving , lost power steering assist, very hard to steer. took  to dealer and got the following error code - c0545 - steering wheel torque sensor.  this has happened twice and in both occasions, it is very hard to steer . in both instances, driving on the highway and very hard to pull over. once you e error dissapears"
when vehicle runs out of gas and only has battery power (no matter the charge) the car goes into reduced power mode which is dangerous in any traffic especially interstate highways!!! this happens every time you run of gas!! also the adaptive cruise not working all the time and disengages by its self for no reason(like nothing in front of you)!!
electronic steering assist went out on ford focus making it almost impossible to drive.  my focus is a 2013 with only 15000 miles and only used for 20 miles transportation a day 5 days a week.  initially was moving and was able to pull into a parking space.  it hasn't worked since.
"power steering failure at 63000 miles.  resulting in $2222 bill to replace power steering gear assembly.      error code ""steering assist fault service required"" was displayed 5-8 times while backing up at startup on prior occasions.  for all prior occasions restarting the car cleared the issue.  on the last occurrence the issue would not clear leaving the car with manual steering."
"when driving the vehicle on freeways with adaptive cruise control enabled, if the vehicle approaches a vehicle in an adjacent lane (typically a larger vehicle like a truck with a trailer, semi, or tanker) the collision aid activates and heavily applies the brakes. if someone is following close behind me, as has happened in at least 4 instances, the individual will need to stop and make an emergency maneuver to avoid colliding. in both cases, the braking only lasted momentarily but was enough to reduce the vehicles speed 20-30 mph during that time. the vehicle has been inspected by ford but they have said that there is nothing that they can do. for the time being, we keep this feature disabled until ford can get this issue resolved. there have been recalls for previous years but ours is not included. because of this ford has said there's nothing they can do on multiple attempts to get the problem resolved."
"power steering assist failure on dash. making things difficult to turn in low speed turns. contacted ford and was told the computer was flashed in 2013, before i even owned the car. was told that it would be my responsibility and to hold receipts because i be able to get reimbursed for part or all of costs associated with this issue. now ford says no go! looking around on issues with the torque sensor and noted many people going through the same as i have. seems to me ford is just trying to get more parts replaced and doesn't care about our safety. this is an attempt to get ford on the ball to fix their vehicles. i've been a ford person for a long time, but considering going to take my future car purchases to other cars. come on ford!"
"this is a complaint about the steering pilot part of the driver assistance package option i have on my 2018 mercedes-benz gls-450.  the steering pilot is so poorly developed it has almost caused me to crash several times, so i have turned it off most of the time.  the mbusa website says of steering pilot, ' the steering pilot feature helps the driver keep the vehicle centered between lane markings while cruising on straight roads, or even in gentle curves.'    nothing could be further from the truth.  when deployed, steering pilot causes my  vehicle to wander back and forth in the lane as a drunk driver would, often crossing the center or gutter line, activating lane keeping assist. the vehicle tends to drive toward the left of center, not in the center of the lane. steering pilot tries to take off ramps to the left or right from the freeways, and tries to turn down streets on surface roads when i want to go straight.  it appears to have no learning or update capability, even though there is an internet station in the vehicle.  i presume mb engineers are monitoring steering pilot's performance and camera pictures, but why no upgrades in performance like my tesla friends enjoy with their auto drive systems?     the steering pilot seems to be advertised as much more capable than it really is, and is so dangerous i think it probably should have never been offered until it was much more developed!"
"this sunday may 20 i was driving my tesla model s southbound on route 1 in rehoboth to work in autopilot mode. i had this feature of my vehicle set to 50 mph. if you aren't familiar with autopilot in tesla's, let me explain how it works. once the vehicle indicates the feature can be activated, you press a button as you would any other vehicle with basic cruise control, and the car will literally accelerate, decelerate, and steer itself without further input from the driver.    while using this feature of my vehicle, i had a significant accident on route 1. as i said, my vehicle was traveling at a rate of 50 mph. i was driving in the left lane southbound with autopilot activated. in turnabout in the median, a white pickup was perpendicular to my car with sticking out about 1 ft into my lane. the left side of my car skimmed the back of his car without slowing down. autopilot failed to recognize the car was there.     i am lucky i wasn't killed, and i am lucky no one else was hurt. this accident has shaken me up quite a bit.     now, i do not blame tesla 100% for this auto accident; i don't plan to file a legal claim against them or anything like that. in fact, i plan on replacing my vehicle with another tesla (without the said autopilot features) but i would be doing a disservice to anyone without trying to use this experience of mine to hopefully save lives in the future.    i brought these exact issues up with tesla regarding my accident several times to several different departments and my concerns have been totally dismissed. if regulation for features like these in vehicles is not implemented, unfortunately i have no doubt in my mind people will be hurt and possibly killed,"
"just returned back home from a vacation and was driving my entire family back home from the airport.  the weather was nice so i had the windows down while on the freeway.  as i went to exit the freeway going about 72 mph, i realize the steering seemed more difficult than usual, but thought nothing more and proceeded to make a sharp left hand turn of the freeway going about 35 mph.  as i entered the turn, i quickly realized the power steering was not working, as i struggled to keep my car from crashing into the bridge wall.  as we came to a stop i noticed a message displayed on the dash about a power steering assist failure and the traction control was off.  i never heard the warning due to the road noise and was caught completely off guard.  had my wife been driving or the road been wet or snow covered, i am convinced, we would have crashed!  my 2011 mercury milan has roughly 121,000 miles on it.  after several days since, the power steering still does not work.  my wife is afraid to drive the car as she can't even turn the car it out of our driveway as it takes considerable force to turn the wheel."
power steering assist fault. suddenly lost power steering while driving car. turned car off and then back on and fault went away and regained power steering for a few weeks. lost power steering again while driving and car violently jerked to the right. after turning ignition key on and off several times the steering assist fault would not go away. drove car home without power steering and fault will not disappear.

"in moderate to heavy rain with the toyota dynamic cruise control engaged on the highway between 55 and 70 mph, the prius has dangerously accelerated itself towards a car immediately in front of my car and would have created a front-to-rear collision if i was not extremely vigilant and manually braked and canceled the adaptive cruise system within 10-20 feet of the car in front of me.  the system seems to operate blindly in moderate to heavy rain and will accelerate to user-set speed even when a car is traveling slower immediately in front of my vehicle.   i strongly suspect the pre-collision braking is failing at the same time as the dynamic cruise (in rain) since it relies on the same components.      the prius prime needs to be reprogrammed to not allow dynamic cruise engagement in moderate to heavy rain.      this is a very dangerous situation because driver visibility is already impaired under these conditions.  if this did not occur multiple times, i would not have believed it was actually happening.  the prius manual says that rain can cause the system to not behave as intended; however, in that case it needs to be automatically disabled so it does not create a very false sense of security. this is going to cost lives if it's not reprogrammed.    i would be surprised if this was the only toyota that exhibits this dangerous behavior.  i strongly believe that lives can be saved with a simple reprogram of the system to not allow operation under conditions that can create unintended acceleration into a slower moving vehicle.  toyota should save themselves millions in potential liability and take this suggestion seriously."

"reportedly a 2015 tesla model s on ""autopilot"" crashed into a laguna beach police patrol vehicle on tuesday about 11am 5-29-18 @ 20652 laguna canyon road, laguna beach, california. the driver of the tesla was injured. the driver is probably at fault for inattentive driving, however the hype from tesla, elon musk and the cult following have contributed to tesla drivers driving recklessly by overhyping the safety and autonomy of tesla vehicles. it seems the vehicle left the driving lane and entered the parking lane at the side of the road. reportedly elon musk and other management rejected sensors and other technology that could have improved safety and autonomy. reportedly tesla management rejected requests by their own engineers that wanted lidar, eye sensing and other technology that would have improved safety. tesla has a history of censoring safety advocates and trying to censor the media, thus preventing whistleblowers from improving safety through public awareness. tesla also has a history of scapegoating their own customers and other tesla drivers; to draw attention away from the faults of tesla. the ""swiss cheese model"" indicates that most crashes involve several causal/contributing factors. there also needs to be more emphasis on the psychology of ""human factors"". tesla hype and tesla censorship of media and safety advocates are some of the human factors that is contributing to tesla drivers driving more recklessly, unsafe and arrogantly."

"2012 acura tsx 100k miles extremely well maintained. shortly after leaving work yesterday i was driving on a very busy street(45 mph zone) in rush hour and lost complete steering control. the car was extremely difficult to steer. lost all power steering assist. i proceeded to pull in to a parking lot, turned the vehicle off and then on again and steering assist was back. continued on my drive home and it happened again while in motion 45 mph. pulled off the road, cycled the ignition again and power assist was back. thankfully i was not mid turn when this happened or an accident very well could have occurred. the vehicle gave no warning whatsoever before this happened. very dangerous. my husband is a ase certified technician and has not been able to duplicate the problem again since it has happened, so he is currently not able to pin point if its the eps module, steering gear, or torque sensor. we don't want to throw a $1200 part at it based on a guess. this is way too many complaints on such a serious issue for honda not to have issued a recall. toyota would have been on this like white on rice. we bought a honda for a reason, reliability. currently its a nerve racking car to drive with the potential of causing serious injury or death along with all the other hondas/acuras using this same eps system. please submit this to honda."

no action from dealer ford i received recall letter since 2016 now i have new complaints regards to power steering assist fault service advancetrac
i turned in my ford fusion after all the gauges stopped moving and i let the computer turn on. when i did this the warning about service advanced trac blinked on and said power steering assist fault. i turned off my vehicle again and same thing. the error code has not gone away and my vehicle no longer has power steering.

"recently purchased a 2018 mercedes-benz e400 4matic wagon with premium package 3 that includes all of the available driver assistance programs (semi autonomous steering, adaptive cruise control, lane keep assistance, blindspot detection, automatic parking assist, cross traffic alert). according to mercedes, the program titled drive pilot with steer assist, is able to keep the vehicle in the lane when there are lane markings or even follow a car ahead if there are no lane markings. well, this system is terrible. it can't stay centered in the lane, instead it feels like you're playing a game of pong going back and forth between the lane markers. that is, when it works. when it doesn't work (most of the time), you will be going down the road and it suddenly starts drifting out of the lane to follow the curve of an off ramp or it suddenly disables itself because it can't figure out where the lane markings are. there's no audible warning or big visual cue the steer assist has ended, just a tiny little steering wheel icon in the head up display turns from green to gray. mercedes advertised this system to be better than or at least on par with tesla's autopilot, yet it can't read stop lights, can't even stay in well marked lanes and combined with the adaptive cruise control that has no way of changing how quickly it accelerates, feels like the car is out of control. what i find even more disappointing is that the mercedes apparently will not be given software updates to improve the system unlike tesla who is constantly providing their vehicles with over the air updates. if mercedes can't do ota updates fine, but they must update these cars are the dealers. i feel like this system desperately needs a software update to be even marginally functional. dealer has no clue about these issues because our car was one of the only ones ordered with all of the assistance programs."
"while driving vehicle at highway speed, the vehicle lost electric steering control and two codes appeared on the dash - service advancetrac and power steering assist fault. the vehicle was travelling at 65ish while completing a sloping turn on the capital beltway, the vehicle pulled to the right and required extensive arm force to remain in control. the vehicle was safely moved to the shoulder of the road and towed to the dealer for service."
"at the time of the occurrence the vehicle had been owned for approximately 90 days and had approximately 2500 miles on the odometer.    when initially started in a stationary poistion the information display provided multiple apparently spurious alarms and warnings. these warnings continued when the vehicle was in motion. turning the vehicler off and restarting the vehiclewould not clear the warnings.     the display would cycle displaying *adaptive cruise control problem*,*lane departure mitigation system problem*, and *emmissions control system problem*. addtionally the brake system and lane departure mitigation system malfunction lights and check engine light were illuminated    the vehicle was taken to a dealer who reset the codes using proprietary honda  vehicle analysis software. the warning and codes did not re-appear.    the cause for the warnings was not determined.    these apparently spurious warnings present a safety concern. they provide a distraction to the driver while cycling on the informaiton display and could cause a driver to ignore valid warnings in the belief they too are spurious.    the issue is such that it warrants monitoring by the manufacturer and ntsb to determine the root cause of the problem and frequency of occurrence."
"i was backing out of a parking place at a gas station when the ""steering assist fault"" ""service required"" came on this happened around 80k miles. now sitting at 88k miles i recently had to have the steering rack and pinion assembly replaced in it costing me almost 1,800 dollars in repairs. i have read several complaints with this car having the same issues around about the same mileage intervals.  i'm hoping this issue hasn't caused any serious injury or fatalities."
"1) gas tank never takes more than 15 gallons of gas when the gas tank was supposed to hold 18 gallons. one day the fuel computer showed the range as 15 miles and the gas tank still took only 15 gallons from the pump even when the car gets a mileage of more than 30 mpg. also, the pump abruptly stops in between and i have to restart pumping the fuel. this is either a fuel guage problem showing the gas tank is nearly empty when its really not or a gas tank problem. online research indicates that multiple people have this problem.     2) the adaptive cruise control is really jerky and slams the breaks suddenly and accelerates abruptly resulting in a very jerky ride."
"the power steering fails and returns to manual steering. ""power steering assist failure"" message is displayed. turning the car on/off will sometimes fix issue but it has happened while driving making it dangerous to steer"
"driving on freeway, a car was stopped ahead, hit brakes, automatic braking system did not engage, hit rear of car ahead directly without much slowdown compared to expectation, possibly skidding straight, for what seemed like 2-3 seconds (long enough to be puzzled) or forever. have not had automatic braking kick in a lot of times in past, never had an accident like this. no fluid leakages seen on ground before or after accident. car was drivable but totaled, no injury reported. tires 1 year old. had just gotten on freeway, which had turned to straightaway, so might have been going around 50 when braking started, maybe 15-20 on impact. passenger side air bag went off."
power steering assist fault pops up when car starts and steering wheel does not move
"over 2 years ago, at start up, the power steering assist failure warning appeared. i couldn't drive the car. i took it to the dealer and was advised of a recall on fusions, but not on my vin. very frustrating! they reset the electronics and it was okay for only a couple of months. since then, i receive the warning several times a month... consistently. i found if i turn the car off and back on, it would reset and power steering would resume. however, on thursday, 6/7/18, it would not reset. i had to have the car towed and was advised still no recall on my car, it is out of warranty now,  and it can only be reset once; i have to pay $1600 to change the rack.   this is extremely disconcerting. this is the same problem as original concern 2 years ago and my car is outside of the recall."
"backing out of the driveway, my steering locked and ""steering assist failure. service needed"" appeared then disappeared. i almost hit a tree behind me. when i got the car to the shop i was told that the entire power steering compound gear assembly unit had to be replaced and it would cost me $1700. not only is this issue expensive but extremely dangerous. i was lucky it happened in the driveway and not actually on my way to or from work with rush hour traffic, causing an accident."
"on friday, 06/08/2018 i lost my steering assist due to a ""steering assist malfunction"". i am able to steer the car but as a senior citizen i feel that i am putting my life, as well as others, at risk for a known defect that the ford motor company has known about for years, have recalled many of their model vehicles with the same ""defect"" except the ford focus. this is a dangerous  situation for everyone. please get ford motor company to correct their intentional neglect of this matter."

"there has been so many malfunctions, deaths and fires caused by tesla's auto pilot feature. so many government  investigations are going on, and  the result of some investigations that have been completed sounds alarming. tesla's auto pilot feature is under intense government scrutiny. today, elon announced that all tesla cars will be fully automated driverless in august. elon has become desperate, insane and dangerous. he has no regard for public safety. is he crazy? are you kidding me? please stop this dangerous and fraudulent man, and put him in prison forever. he is irrational, cruel and lethal. it reminds me of president assad of syria using chemical weapons on his own people. it also reminds me of saddam hossein using chemical weapons on kurdish people and on iranian soldiers during iran iraq war. please keep in mind that it's against the law to use chemical weapons in a conventional war. however, saddam hossein did so and killed so many iranian soldiers during the 8 year war between iran and iraq. i saw pictures of so many iranian severely injured and burned soldiers being air lifted to germany from the war zone, because iran didn't have the medical capability to handle this situation. nothing can be done anyways. once you are exposed to mustard gas, you're finished. it's just the matter of quick death, or very painful prolonged death. elon now has turned to chemical weapons out of desperation just like saddam hossein and bashar assad. thanks."

"power steering fails at random times at any speed creating extremely dangerous driving situations in a relatively large truck. it is difficult for me (a 180 pound man) to control the vehicle without the steering assist and nearly i had a serious accident as a result. there was a partial gm recall on 2015 chevrolet colorados for exactly this reason (recall # 15595a) however, the dealer said this 'did not apply to my vin' and expects me to pay 1,700 dollars to replace a flawed system with the same flawed system. the problem i experience is identical to the issue described in the recall; on top of this, my vehicle only has around 43,000 miles. loss of power steering given my vehicles low mileage, good maintainence record and that i have never placed any significant mechanical strain or been in an accident clearly indicates to me, particularly given the strikingly applicable recall i mentioned, that this is a manufacturing error. i have found literally dozens upon dozens of similar complaints on forums, including one accident that resulted from this. i frankly am very frustrated with gm and feel that if their shoddy design is putting my and others lives in harms way, at least they should pay to replace the system with the same crummy system."

"we're facing an urgent matter. tesla will be releasing a software update over the air in august to enable all existing tesla cars on the road to be fully autonomous. i believe that tesla should be prevented immediately to do this. there has been so many malfunctions committed by the auto pilot that has resulted in several deaths, injuries, crashes, destructions, blood flows and severe burns all over several human beings. mr. musk shouldn't be allowed to use our humans as lab rats. we're not his ginny pigs. is he kidding us? tesla and other companies like uber that are interested in developing autonomous driving cars are under extreme scrutiny  by the government. does elon honestly think that we're stupid?  as usual, he is taking reckless and irrational risks. please hold them accountable. please don't let him get away with potential murders intentionally.   first, he needs to demonstrate that his technology is safe, then he should be allowed to implement it. that is just common sense, specially considering all the deaths, destructions and blood flows on our asphalts that have been caused by tesla auto pilot malfunctions, and uber autonomous car malfunction that killed a pedestrian recently. this is for public safety for the world. again, it only makes common sense.  please stop this unsafe, corrupt and fraudulent act immediately. would you allow your kids, family members and friends to use this unproven technology? i certainly wouldn't. please take a look at the enclosed model x picture that was recently involved in a crash in mountain view, ca that killed an apple engineer because the auto pilot malfunctioned. please look at the destruction and the blood flow.  do you see the blood? thanks. please let me know.    please help me. this is for our public safety. what elon is doing doesn't make sense."
"at 670 miles, i was driving slowly around a corner when i heard a long beep followed by a ""collision mitigation braking system problem. see your dealer"" message. the adaptive cruise control also stopped working. i restarted the car and the error went away. about a week later at 813 miles, i was driving in a straight road at 55 mph with the adaptive cruise control engaged when i heard a long beep, the adaptive cruise control disengaged, and i received the same error message as before. restarting the vehicle clears the error and allows the adaptive cruise control to work again until the next time it occurs. both times this has happened were on warm, sunny, clear days with dry roads and no obstructions in front of the radar or camera units. yesterday, the cmbs failed to alert me to a four-wheeler that drove across the street in front of me and it seems less sensitive at detecting other vehicles now - even when there are no error messages or warning indicators present."

"power steering assist fault light comes on and power steering locks up or becomes very difficult to steer.  i barely avoided an accident.  i had to stop the car in traffic because i couldn't steer the car.  i found i could barely steer the car with great effort and was able to drive car to side of road.  this very same issue appears to be across many ford/lincoln 2010-2013 models.  there was a recall for apparently the exact issue in 2015 (included 2011-2013 lincoln mkt) but not the 2010 which i have.  my car is experiencing the exact issue.  a quick research online shows that this problem is experienced by many ford/lincoln cars sharing the same ""electronic power steering assist"" system.  this is a very serious and dangerous issue!  the steering of the car itself become locked and nearly inoperable while driving.  apparently the nhtsa is already looking at this very issue (see here: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2016/10/03/fusion-edge-nhtsa-investigation/91473188/).  the nhtsa needs to know that the issue is common to the ""electronic steering assist system"" not only in the ""fusion"" or ""edge"" but across many ford/lincoln models including the lincoln mkt.  the specific ford/lincoln part is a ""trw gen 1 epas"" module.  this same module is used on many ford/lincoln cars.  only some of the cars containing the ""trw gen 1 epas"" module were part of past recalls.  all ford/lincoln models containing the ""trw gen 1 epas"" module should be recalled/repaired before someone gets killed."
"issue 1: adaptive cruise control many times unintentionally accelerates even if it is very clear the front vehicle is slowing down calmly or even stopping;   until it is too close the car itself activates emergency auto braking but for a second acceleration being still on before it deactivates  (usually acc does this calmly and safely). in some cases i had to do emergency braking since it misses the detection of car infront of you; it will be also very hard to do at a time if car just starts to do very high acceleration.   second issue is that  a stationary vehicle is detected or not detected with 50/50 success.   third issue is autobraking , as seen in issue 1, even in normal driving there is no guarantee it will brake; i had several incidents to have emergency brake myself.     fourth issue: when car stops at a certain angle  downhill wheels partially turned right. then immediately if tries to join a main road to the right, but slightly uphill, the car stalls for a 3-5 sec, before it accelerates. this makes it unsafe if there is heavy traffic and  joining the road.   the dates are multiple so i will put the last incident date here. *tt  *tr"
"on multiple occasions our 2018 vw atlas has had its emergency braking feature engage in an unexpected and dangerous way.  specifically, during urban driving when having to traverse the normal dip from driveway to street, across a gutter or other low point, the emergency braking system abruptly halts the vehicle and disables movement.  when this occurs it is extremely jarring and shuts down normal operation, requiring some sort of gear change or restart.  it occurs more frequently when accelerating faster over the dip resulting in a more bumpy movement. it is a major problem when you're attempting to turn into moving traffic quickly.  it leaves the vehicle and passengers especially vulnerable as we're perpendicular to oncoming traffic.  as a mother of 3 small children in car seats, i am extremely concerned."

"complete vehicle system problem messages. vehicle stability, adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation, road departure mitigation, electrical parking brake, emissions system, brake system, brake hold, power steering, hill start assist,  tire pressure monitor problem, power steering system problem.   every one of these systems is displaying a 'problem' message as well as brake light is flashing on the dashboard engine light is on brake system light is on steering wheel light is on vehicle stability light is on battery light is on and oil lamp is on. this is about the fifth time this has happened. i have also experienced this while driving.  the vehicle will suddenly display all these error messages for no apparent reason.  sometimes the error messages will pop up as soon as you turn the car on other times it happens suddenly while driving.  it happens on city streets and on the highway straight away or turning"
while driving at 70 mph the left wheel felt like it was going left and the right felt like it was going right while holding wheel straight.  very difficult to control. then steering assist fault message and traction control light came on.
"while vehicle was in motion (parking),  error power steering assist fault and service advancetrac error illuminated on the dashboard. no longer able to steer car, the car did not default into manual steering mode. the car will only go straight. the car was towed to the dealer. the dealer reported that the module in the steering gear lost communication and that the entire steering gear needs to be replaced as a result.  nhtsa issued recall id #14v286000 on some ford explorer vehicles for some steering gear failures, however the ford dealer states that my vehicle was not included in that recall in their oasis system."
"recently bought a used 2010 ford fusion se 2.5 for my teenage daughter, after a few weeks of owning it, the car would once in a while pop up a ""service power steering now"" message on the info display, when it did this it would disable the electric power steering.. it didn't matter if you were driving down the highway or in a parking lot.  pulling over, shutting it off, and restarting would temporarily clear it up, until the day that ""steering assist fault"" appeared and never went away.. now i have a car with no power steering for my teenage daughter.. took it to a local shop, they called back later and said ""we can't fix it because after we replace the steering rack it has to be flashed, and that has to be done at the dealer"".. i called the dealer, a $1,400 power steering repair on a ford sedan?  really?  this isn't a high end german car.. why on earth would ford not do a recall for all of these?  do a google search, this is quite obviously a design flaw."
"although car less than one week old and under 470 miles, all the warning indicators illuminated on the instrument panel while vehicle was stationary after starting the car: engine system problem, brake system problem, adaptive cruise control problem, road departure mitigation system problem. turning car off and restarting engine did not clear the problem, and lights remained on while driving. vehicle was taken to dealership where it was purchased (honda of pasadena)."
"i bought the car with 62,301 miles on it. at 90k miles, i'm on my way to work, and while driving around a curve i noticed a tug like feeling in my steering wheel.  i thought i was imagining it. besides of that little s curve, it's a strait shot to work.  i needed gas, so i went to turn into the gas station and almost hit a truck parked there because i had no steering.  i turned the wheel a full 360 and luckily managed a turn enough to miss the guys truck by inches (literally).  in my complete embarrassment, i jump out apologizing and told him the issue. he stated he seen me cranking the wheel and figured as much and offered to check the steering fluid for me.  astound to find there was nothing to check.  i took it to laclairs in chesaning mi, and this is what the repair order reads : power steeringquit while driving. and now steering binds and clunks and can barely turn, scanned system, but no codes stored, contacted tech assist center..unpowered steering assist motor then steering module. condition no duplicated, replaced steering gear assembly and performed front and rear alignment as needed reset front and rear toe. $672.33. i chose the remanufactured part hoping that what ever the problem was with the original would have been fixed before they could put it back on the shelf,  now, at 131 k miles, only 42 k miles since that repair, the same issue has returned.  now, i have to once again pay to have it looked at, and once again pay for the repairs.  i have seen several complaints from many different years from people with this same year with the same complaint and yet there has not been a recall made.  i looked up the recall information when i first had this problem and like everyone else my vin was not part of the recall, yet my car has the same issue. it's not just the power steering that failed, it was all the steering. a full 360 turn and only moved little inchs"
i was driving on a city street turning left. on my way to pick up my son when my power steering went out and a prompt showed on my dashboard saying power steering assist fault.
"the first problem was with the transmission, ford extended the warranty to cover whatever the part was out to 150k miles.  the second problem was the radio/sync system quit working.  and as of today july 7 a steering assist fault warning is coming up on the dash.  i did some research and the problem does not appear to be an isolated incident.  the steering assist fault warning comes on when you start the vehicle, we have not seen it happen while in motion."
"on july 5, 2018 i was driving at 35 mph on a city road when a warning light with the words ""steering assist fault, service required"" suddenly came on and the steering stopped working almost entirely. there was very little manual ability to steer the car. fortunately we were on a very wide, empty road, so i was able to use both lanes and get the car to my house. if this had occurred on a busy city street or narrow lane, with any kind of traffic, we could have easily been in a serious, even fatal collision. i hope that other ford owners will report this problem if they experience it, so that a recall can be initiated if needed. this was a dangerous system failure that should be investigated."
"this morning, when my wife started the car and an error message showed up that 'steering assist fault service required'. and the steering was locked and very hard to turn. i did some search online and it turned out it is the common issue for ford and 2010-2013 taurus was on the recall list. just wonder why 2014 was not when the problem exists the same."
"while driving down a gravel road at approximately 35 mph, the power steering stopped working. the vehicle displayed a message  advising the power steering assist had failed and a service advancetrac was showing. i was able to drive the vehicle home, but it was very difficult to turn. luckily, my wife was not driving down a busy highway or in a curve as that would have easily resulted in a bad accident. the local ford dealership advised the steering gear assembly is bad."
"tl* the contact owns a 2014 ford escape. while driving approximately 30 mph, the vehicle lost all ability to steer. the message center displayed ?power steering assist contact dealer immediately "". the vehicle was towed to the dealer (wehr ford, 11311 us-60 bus, mountain grove, missouri 65711) where it was diagnosed that the power steering module failed and needed replacement. the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was notified of the failure. the approximate failure mileage was 3,450. "
2014 1500 ltz almost killed myself several times in the past week. lights begin to flicker and that's the first warning sign to watch for. steering assist shuts down and truck stalls if turn continues at low speed. shut down has happened various times now putting through a drive thru.    vehicle also shuts off while driving at 75mph
"the problem began in my 2017 nissan maxima. i told the dealership that the emergency automatic braking system initiated while no other cars were around. they traded me in to the 2018 nissan rogue and the same issue has occurred 3 times in this vehicle. each time, there were no other vehicles around. the dealership claimed there is nothing wrong with the vehicle. it wasn't until i contacted corporate that they admitted they know there's a defect, but no fix was available yet. they knowingly jeopardized my infant son's safety and lied to me. this defect is scary and shouldn't be allowed to be swept under the rug by the dealerships. i no longer feel safe driving with nissan."
"adaptive cruise control unavailable randomly occurs while driving using adaptive cruise control. presents a large danger of hitting other vehicles if the adaptive cruise control is used to come to a complete stop as it will randomly disengage while coming to a stop. cruise control only works 4/10 times attempted and was ""fixed"" by the dealer with less than 500 miles on the odometer. however the problem recurred within a day. looked it up in forums and it is not an uncommon problem. holding foot under the brake pedal allows cruise control to work but is more dangerous than randomly cutting off. no one in volt forum has gotten a complete fix to date. when they do i will be getting mine repaired armed with the correct information. but it is dangerous."
automatic braking system is faulty. when i pull out of driveways or parking lots the sensors are activating and the maneuver braking is applied and the car comes to an abrubt stop in the middle of the road. everytime this has occured there has not been an object or car present. this system is faulty and dangerous. i have 3 children in the back seat and this makes me very concerned for their safety when i drive this vehicle. vw service is looking into the issue and has given me a loaner atlas that is doing the exact same thing. i have a video of the issue occuring.
"luckily my wife was driving at a slow rate of speed and only a block from the house, when with no warning lost power steering. the dash lit up with power steering assist fault. after researching i found many instances of this happening and fire having a recall on 2008-2011 ford escapes. once going to my local ford service center i was informed that my vehicle was not one of them. clearly a safety issue they need to fess up to."
"i have a 2013 ford f150 fx2 and when driving the past few days, the ""power steering assist fault"" signal came on and i automatically lose power steering in the truck. this has happened when starting the truck but also while moving and driving on the road (roughly 40 mph). luckily, i was on a low traffic road to where i could get over however, this could be extremely dangerous on a busy highway. if my wife was driving at the time, she wouldn't be able to manually pull the steering wheel and get off the road and potentially get into an accident. based on research, a lot of fords are experiencing this and action needs to be taken!"
"two week old nissan rogue. the emergency braking system activates in the parking garage where i work. it seems to happen anywhere in the garage (any floor) and when i surpass ~15mph. spoke with the dealer and they are going to take a look at it, but going by the number of similar complaints on this site i'm beginning to think nissan needs to issue a fix and recall. *tt"
"the first time, the vehicle was in the garage and as i was backing out, the traction control and power steering assist failure warnings came. i turned off the car and everything seemed to reboot. the next time i was just pulling out of a parking lot, but this time, the car took numerous attempts to finally reboot. then i was on a highway and was barely able to make it to the breakdown lane to stop and try to regain power steering. that was very dangerous! shortly thereafter, i turned on the car in the garage, and the light came on and never went out along with the power steering.      my question is; why is this exact problem a recall for 2011 2012 2013 explorers but not 2014? my acquaintance also has an explorer and is experiencing the same issue. clearly ford is aware of this dangerous malfunction."
"on july 5th when i got in my vehicle to go to work i tried to start the car and at first it wouldn't start. tried again and the car started and then many warning lights flashed on the dashboard. power steering assist fault  and traction control on. and told o service immediately.i tried backing out of my garage but steering wheel was completely locked up and unable to steer. had the car towed to dealership after 5 days was called back and was told the he power steering rack would have to be replaced and the battery was bad too. for a total cost of $2600. from other reports online his happens frequently with fusions. there was a recall for the steering rack by my model was not included. only 42,000 miles on car with regular driving and parked in garage when not in use. vehicle should not have failed this quickly. if i was driving when this happened i would have had not control and most likely would have crashed."
the electronic power steering assist (epas) went out while while my wife was manuevering through a parking lot one time and while driving down the road another time. luckily no accident resulted from either occurence.
"i purchased my 2018 rogue sl awd in mid march 2018 and i have been dealing with issues since march 27th. the first issue that i've noticed was a very major incident that has happened 3 times while driving on the interstate (got video)  the (feb) forward emergency braking engaged while driving luckily no other vehicles were around!  allegedly this issue was rectified on july 11th! also the audio system does a reset and locks up most times! i have to turn the vehicle off to get it to work!  the wheels have spots on them very  noticeable when the sun reflects on them (have photo) the dealership fixed them looks good they claim they buff them out but they look brand new. i've been in a loaner vehicle since june 27th and it's july 12th  2017.5 rogue sl awd i've noticed a huge difference especially in mpg i'm currently getting 28.9 mpg and in my 2018 i'm getting an avg of 24-25mpg without a/c running! the reason why we are getting less gas mileage in the 2018 awd is because the 4x4-i system is running 50% torque on rear wheels longer then needed! in the '17.5 it runs 50% torque in the first gear upon take off and then adjust as needed (switch your display to the 4x4-i and watch how long the torque is used on the rear wheels)!  on a dry surface you do not need that much torque throughout the other gears! i pointed that out to the technician and he gave me a slight nod! (the accelerator sensor, yaw rate sensor or 4wd controller may not be working correctly!) and the final issue is the engine brake is not engaging when you slow down to between 25 to 40 mph  the tech odometer should rise up to 2 to 4 rpm  according to your speed while approaching a stoplight or stopping  and in the 2018 it doesn't do that it rises up to about 1.5 rpms! you will probably not noticed that if you've never driven a nissan with a cvt in it! i hope this helps and we get the these fixed! *tt  *tr"

"vehicle loses power steering during turns at low speeds and will also turn vehicle off. if vehicle does not turn off, vehicle will display ""redused power steering assist"" and a stabilitrak warning. if vehicle turns off, vehicle will not turn on right away and dashboard display will not turn on when key is in the on position. after attempts to turn vehicle on, the smell of burning wires is smelled in the cab with no obvious electrical fire."

"i was driving about 70mph on the highway west bound in the morning, no direct sunlight, it was an overcast day. i had the adaptive cruise control on. for no reason at all my car slammed on the brakes, did a moderate nose dive and locked my seat belt. no warning what so ever. there was not another car for at least a 1/4 to 1/2 mile in front of me. unfortunately there were cars behind me. i quickly disengaged the adaptive cruise control and floored the gas, avoiding an accident from the rear.  i had this identical problem with a 2016 honda civic touring, and every time i reported it, the dealership would blame sunlight, even if there was none when it happened. something needs to be done about this."
"steering randomly went out while stationary in a parking lot. turned car on and got the error message ""power steering assist fault"". could have been even more dangerous if car was in motion. recalls on 2011 and 2012 fusions but not 2010. repair is very costly."
power steering assist randomly will not work when starting car. makes it so the car is very hard turn. have to turn the car off and back on again to reset system. has been happening more often recently and am afraid it will happen while driving.
vehicle lost the ability to power steer when vehicle was turned on making it difficult to drive. warning sign said power steering assist fault. the issue had occurred several times but i just turn it off and turn it back on and the issue would come off but this last time it didnt.
steering assist stabilizer reduced error on dashboard and vehicle shuts down.
"have had several incidents of the power steering assist warning coming on, and steering is extremely hard to maneuver. been told this is extremely dangerous if it occurs at highway speeds. also told it is very expensive to fix."
"tl* the contact owns a 2009 ford escape. while driving approximately 25 mph and attempting to make a turn, the vehicle hesitated, stalled, and restarted. the contact stated that the steering lost power and the ""power steering assist fault"" indicator illuminated. the contact called turnpike ford of charleston/marmet at 304-925-0431 (located at 7891 maccorkle ave, charleston, wv 25315) and was informed that the steering was serviced in 2014 per nhtsa campaign number: 14v284000 (steering). the failure was not diagnosed due to the diagnostic testing fee. the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was made aware of the failure and stated that there was no recall. the failure mileage was approximately 139,000.

"i purchased the car july 3rd, 2018. driving on a trip at around 900 miles and had the adaptive cruise control engaged. the car made a beeping sound and the cruise control powered off. a message came up stating collision mitigation breaking system needed to be serviced. the cruise would not come back on. when i arrived at the destination i turned the car off, and upon turning it back on the warning was gone. i drove home with no problem."
power steering assist fault error would come on when turning onto a street which would eliminate all power steering to the vehicle.  this would happen at anytime when driving.  i had the vehicle (2013 ford escape) serviced on 7-18-18 at the dealership.  the service center informed me that the error was caused by a faulty electronic assist rack and pinion and needed to be replaced.  my vehicle has only 41000 miles.  i feel this is a safety issue and should be noted for a recall.
"tl* the contact owns a 2014 ford taurus. while attempting to reverse from a parking space, the steering ability of the vehicle became very difficult and seized. in addition, the electronic control system and power steering assist warning indicators illuminated. the vehicle was taken to the dealer (autonation ford orange park florida, 7700 blanding blvd., jacksonville, fl 32244, (904) 270-9943) where it was diagnosed that the electronic control system module and power steering module needed to be replaced. the vehicle was being repaired. the manufacturer was notified of the failure. the approximate failure mileage was 7,500."
"my wife was backing her 2016 ford explorer limited out of the garage when warnings regarding power steering assist failure, terrain management system fault, service advance trac appeared on the instrument cluster and she lost the ability to steer the vehicle. luckily she was basically stationary at the time. this was the first incident of this type, and unlike other reports i have read, restarting the vehicle did nothing to restore the power steering.  the vehicle was towed to the dealership where we were told that the epas electronic steering system had failed and the entire rack and pinion assembly would need to be replaced because this is an integrated system.  when i told them that i thought a catastrophic failure of this type on a major system was unusual in a 21/2 year old vehicle i was told that this was something they had seen before and not that unusual. this is a major and very costly repair, and even more important than the repair cost is the safety concern. reading other reports of people loosing control on the highway when this system fails makes me wonder if i should let my wife continue driving the vehicle after the repair. the service persons at the dealership echoed my concerns and gave me a number to contact ford. it appears there is no update to the epas system and the replacement is the same as the old faulty assembly.  we have owned 3 ford/mercury vehicles of this type and in the past have been very pleased.  it appears from reports that ford is well aware of this problem because other vehicles from other model years have been recalled for epas issues and failure. unless there is a recall and an update to the steering system i must consider replacing this vehicle because of the safety concern."
"tl* the contact leased a 2017 kia cadenza. while driving 65 mph with the adaptive cruise control activated, the vehicle experienced unintended acceleration. as a result, the vehicle was involved in a front end collision. the air bags did not deploy. the contact sustained injuries to the cervical stenosis and a herniated disk in the lower back that required medical attention. a police report was filed. the vehicle was towed to an auto body shop where it was deemed operable. the dealer was not contacted to determine the cause of the failure. the manufacturer was notified of the failure. the failure mileage was approximately 10,000."

"vehicle had just been driving, i stopped, turned car off,  and after 5 minutes turned car back on. when the car was turned on, car was stationary and a memo flashed on dashboard indicating 'automatic steering failure'. after putting the car in reverse i noted the vehicle steering wheel was locked and wouldn't move out of its stationary position. car was towed to ford dealership. mechanic indicated that the automatic power steering rack failed and needed to be replaced."
"my vehicle has been cutting off, all power including all computer screens/dashboard/steering, which last 2-5 seconds, then cuts back on.  the rpm will rev up to the 4-6 thousand range and at times the vehicle will no go over 45mph.  this has happened at 35 mph to 70mph.    while in park, absolutely no gear engaged, the vehicle will lurch forward and backward as though it was in gear.  my foot will not even be on the brake pedal and it will move.   last week the car was turned on, put in drive, i pushed the accelerator, the rpm's went to 4000 and the vehicle did not move.  i looked down to make sure it was in drive, which is was, as i looked up the car lurched forward 2-3 feet.    the emissions system, lane assist light come on randomly.  it will tell me ""steering required"" even when i am driving and do not have the lane assist on.    the dealer has replaced multiple parts, including ""computer updates"", the radar sensing system, but they cannot replicate the issue and have told me they cannot do anything about it.  i have take the vehicle in at least 6-7 times in the last 2 months.  the car is unsafe, still under warranty and the dealer told me ""you are stuck with it"".  this car is a hazard to myself, my family and anyone else on the road.  i have tried to deal with honda corporate and they will not respond.  i believe, from my research, this is an issue with this model that honda refuses to acknowledge."

"i?m contacting you with an issue that needs immediate attention. there is a serious defect with the vw atlas we leased 2 months ago. the automatic braking system deploys at unexpected and inappropriate times producing a life threatening situation.      the automatic braking system has activated, dangerously and inappropriately, several times, usually when pulling out of a driveway and attempting to enter a lane. although there is no obstruction or risk of collision, the car senses the insignificant change in slope from driveway to road and slams on the brakes causing the driver to lose all control.  the car is then stalled in the middle of oncoming traffic.   recently, my wife and two children pulled out of the driveway of our local supermarket and made a left turn. the automatic breaking system was activated and she was left stalled in the middle of oncoming traffic. another driver barely avoided colliding into our rear side door where our 3 year old son?s car seat is located.   we have taken this issue to our local dealership, and they checked the system, and told us ?it is performing as the manufacture intended it to?. this is a serious design issue and its only a matter of time before it results in a major accident and i can only pray that my young children arena?t maimed or killed.  the vw service people have shown us a complicated way to turn off the automatic braking system in the car, however this needs to be done every time you start the car.  i feel its inevitable that a busy mother doing chores with two toddlers will forget to turn off the system at some point.  this matter needs to be resolved before disability or loss of life occurs. there needs to be a way to fix the system or permanently disable it. we asked vw to permanently disable the system but they declined.  we look forward to your prompt reply  thank you.

"i recently started my car after work and got a ""power steering assist failure"" alert while stationary. the power steering has not worked since that incident. it's incredibly difficult to make turns, especially michigan turn-arounds. being that it's electrical, the estimated cost to fix is $1700! i don't have $1700 to fix it, and i have no choice but to drive it around like this. i learned that there were over 400,000 recalls for related incidents, but my vehicle is not recalled. why? i also noticed that of the 1795 complaints on here, 759 of them are for steering issues. that's 42 percent! this is a disaster waiting to happen."

since i have this car having problems  vibrations i took the car on vw dealer few times i explain to them my car is vibrating when i apply the brakes   also when i cruise over 55mph. they told me always car is performing to manufacture specifications so now  i have 6500 miles on my car i took my car to different dealership they found out my tires ar cupping.  and my roots are out of round   and  alignment was correct tire balancing they did few time  tire roatation    so now  i have 6500 miles on the car less then 1 year old car. and vw of usa we cannot cover under  warranty i replace the tires on my own and the car still vibrates idk what to do any further  very disappointed  also having issues with front assist   with adaptive cruise control  and lane assist  no response

"while driving 70 mph with my cruise control on a smooth, level hwy my cruise control cut off abruptly causing an alarm to sound and a notice to service adv trac came up on my screen. at that moment i also discovered my power steering had failed causing the truck to become very difficult to steer. the rapid deceleration caused the car behind me to have to brake hard and get on the shoulder. luckily there was no accident.    i drove the truck home and called my ford dealer the next morning and consequently  took the car to them.  i was informed later that morning that i had had a catastrophic steering failure and that my complete electronic power steering assist (epsa) would have to be replaced to the tune of about $2,000. the truck was delivered new in jan of 2016 only has 45,000 miles on it and i doubt has ever been off of paved roads . i had no choice but to have it repaired and pay the bill.    i contacted ford to see if i could get some help and basically got a very weak response and of course no action.    this failure occurred with absolutely no warning whatsoever and had it happened in traffic or in a more hazardous situation with a physically weaker driver at the wheel there would have almost certainly been a bad accident. after doing some searching i find that this is not an unheard of incident and based on my research would bet ford is aware of this problem. at this point i'm ashamed that i have put so much faith in ford and their products in the past."

"on july 4th 2018. i was driving down freeway at approximately 74 miles per hour, my vehicle decelerated abruptly down to about 40 miles per hour then down to 20 miles per hour. steering wheel become tight and practically locked into place. this portion of the event occured withen two seconds at most. the check engine light came on and the console screen on. the left side of accelerometer displayed multiple messages stating my safety systems where not available, adaptive cruise control was unavailable, forward collusion warning was unavailable, rear parking cam unavailable, parking sensors, unavailable, hill assistance unavailable, these where the ones i read while trying to make avoid a collision but other messages continued to display on the screen. altogether the event in which the deceleration and messages displayed one after the other, in rapid succession, took place inabout 5 to 10 seconds. the sudden deceleration of my vehicle, from 74mph to 20mph forced a large white suv. to quickly adjust lanes and force two other vehicles to move as well in order to avoid an accident. one vehicle was almost forced into a concrete wall but was able to stop, the cars behind had started to manuver around as well. i the driver was able to correct themselves quickly and continue on. my vehicle was unable to accelerate past 20mph. the exit was close, my hazard lights appeared to be be working, and vehicles where paying attention to my vehicle. i took the opportunity to move the vehicle off the free way and park it at a gas station. with the holiday, i couldn't find any open repair shops. while i waited for a ride i found several forums discussing this is a common issue with the 2016 ford fusion energi. after about 12000 miles the throttle body needs to be replaced. sense then i took mine to get fixed, the issue and fix, was replacing the throttle body. ford won't recall!"
while driving home  the power steering assist warning came on and lost all power steering. was very difficult to steer. had it taken to dealer was told this is common problem with the power steering just going out. mileage was 59845 miles
dead battery and now have issues with power steering assist!
"i was driving on the highway when i heard a ""pop,"" there was no alert or warning on the dashboard, but the adaptive cruise control wouldn't cooperate. so i went over on the side of the highway and i found out my passenger rear right side tire had blown out completely."
"tl* the contact owns a 2013 ford explorer. the contact called on behalf of the driver. while driving and making turns, the steering wheel seized and the power steering assist warning indicator illuminated. the driver powered off the engine, restarted the vehicle, and was able to drive normally. the contact stated that the failure recurred numerous times. the contact called sam pack's five star ford carrollton at (972) 242-6415 (located at 1635 s interstate 35e, carrollton, tx 75006) where an appointment was scheduled for diagnostic testing and repairs. the manufacturer was notified of the failure and did not assist. the approximate failure mileage was 47,000.

"car kept shutting down not wanting to start due to gas pump.  i would be driving and would start stalling while drive almost crash.  electrical problems the light flinger on and off while driving and when switch them     with a loss of power steering assist, extra steering effort will be required, especially at lower speeds, increasing the risk of a crash."
"i have had the same problem for some time, and would normally be resolved by turning off the vehicle to 'reset' the warning and turn back on and it would be fine. but today, the steering assist fault service soon warning came on and did not go off. and i have no power steering function in my ford explorer and the advance trac system fault warning also indicated. in the past i have had this happen while driving down a highway and loosing power steering function and have had it happen when pulling out of my garage and lost all power steering function and while driving at low speeds in a town area and lost all power steering function. there is a ford recall for this exact problem in ford explorers years 2011-2013, but i believe this is the exact same issue i am having with my 2015 ford explorer."
"while driving straight at approximately 25-30 mph on a city street with a slight incline and no other vehicles around or inconsistencies in the road surface, the vehicle made a hard and abrupt deceleration combined with a grinding sound for about 2-3 seconds then resumed normal operation. the vehicle had been purchased 2 days earlier and had about 40 miles on the odometer. when contacted, the sales staff claimed no knowledge of a problem but the dealership's service department acknowledged they had a technical service bulletin (tsb 18-041a) alerting them of the issue and they had in fact dealt with similar situations within that service department. they ran diagnostic tests on our vehicle and the laser control module for the emergency braking system failed. they reprogrammed it, tested it, and it failed again. they ordered a new ckd laser control unit, reprogrammed it, performed sensor calibration, road tested it and say they verified all warning lights are out and no codes are reset. they offered to replace the vehicle. this seems to be a random and systemic problem."
"vin: (xxxxx)    vehicle mileage: 28,903  description: i am learning that the radar that controls the emergency braking system, adaptive cruise control, road departure mitigation, collision mitigation etc. is only protected by a ""pop off cover"".   i am deeply concerned over the lack of protection when it comes to such a critical component of my 2017 honda crv.  i am being faced with a minimum $1,100 (part only) bill to repair damage to my cars radar sensor mounted in the front grill. i have had other problems with random ""detection"" computer messages on the dashboard and now for this piece of plastic to be popped off by a small piece of debris on the road that was kicked up from the road by a vehicle traveling in front of me is ridiculous. why would something so important be mounted dead front of the vehicle and not properly protected?     i'm looking for a better option to have this resolved.  i am practically a ""life time"" owner of honda products.  and over the years i have increasingly become more and more unimpressed with what i fell in love with at the beginning of my honda journey.     respectfully    (xxxx)      parts of this document have been redacted to protect personally identifiable information pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6)."
"the car losses steering assistance on the road occasionally. the light saying ""steering assistant fault"" also comes on. then typically after 1day or 2, the system resumes itself.  when it happens, wheel becomes really heavy and not possible to turn at 60-79mph on highway. at lower speed, it needs very hard pulling to just make a normal right or left turning. i also have to decrease speed when making the turn and causing vehicles after to decrease speed also.  the ford manufacturer mechanic have made full diagnostic of the steering part. they couldn't find a reason and also said there could be no reason. the electricity system of related part could just be out of order some time and then became normal again--told by the mechanic. it's also confirmed such disorder is not caused by car wash or cosmetic damage on car's surface. the part is also not repairable but have to be replaced to solve the issue, which appears to be a fault of design or manufacturing.  i searched online and found over hundreds of such issue for ford focus 2012-2014, discussed on forum and also reported by media.  today, before writing this, the fault just happened on my car again. i think it begins to happen more and more frequently ever since the first time. the first time was may 13th, 2018; second was july 19th, then today: aug. 1st.  it is terrifying how frequently it may happen on road in future. and what's more, my car's odometer is only 44k miles.  hope the complaint could be valid and measurement done towards ford.   thank you"
"we parked at a gas station for gas and when we started the car again, it showed ""steering assistant fault"" and it's so hard to turn the steering wheel. we almost called someone to tow the car. we went to a auto shop and the guy said nothing caused this, it's ford's problem and we need to go to a dealer's to replace the steering gear.  we went to a dealer and it cost 2100 to repair. and it's not under warranty."
"my honda civic 2012 is having exact same problem covered under a ""honda service bullitin 14-058"". the ""check power steering alert""  appears at various times and goes off at various times (while not losing power steering assist, so far). honda dealer suggests servicing when car actually loses steering power."
"on tuesday 7/31/18, as i was slowing down to turn onto a neighborhood street, the electronic stability control active warning light came on, a warning that lane assist was unavailable flashed on the dashboard, and the blind spot sensors on both side mirrors turned on with a warning message that the blind spot assistance was unavailable.  after about an 1/8th of a mile, i slowed to a stop sign and the brakes started to feel tight as if they were locking.  the screen on the dashboard went blank and the gauge speedometer was not registering.  i was able to make a slow left turn and then an immediate right turn into a driveway, but as i came to a stop the brakes were completely locked up and nothing was working as if the engine had turned off.  i had to restart the vehicle twice for the dashboard to come back to normal.    had u64 - reprogram powertrain control module and u50 manual park release recalls performed 7/25/18.

"foward collision avoidance - when driving in normal condition, the vehicle will abruptly apply brake by itself activating the forward collision avoidance system. the ""brake"" warning comes-up in the driver's dashboard to provide a visual warning. this happens even if there were no vehicle in-front and anticipated frontal collision. this abrupt and random braking can cause a rear-end collision."
"this vehicle has been sitting for over a month due to my limited income as a veteran i can not afford to repair this issue at an estimate cost of $1600. this issue is not due to my negligence.power steering assist failure is the issue. i was driving it to work in dallas,nc when i experienced the steering wheel locked as i made a right turn into a parking space. after i struggled to get it into the parking space i also struggle to drive it home as well.once i got the vehicle home i called tindol ford in gastonia,nc regarding my concern i was informed that i need to have it diagnosed at my expense of $99. then if it is the epas (electric power assist system) repair estimate cost can be about $1600. this vehicle specifically had a recall before not sure but i think it was for airbag and or seatbelt. well since then i borrowed a temporary vehicle from family member due to repair cost being expensive. this ford fusion has a title lien through bridgecrest, in whom i finance with. vehicle is almost paid in full.this issue however is not any of negligence but more so a manufacturer issue. the epas consist of a trw component which consist of everything to this failure such as the hydraulic the belt drive the drive rack the coder interface etc. i had a local mechanic look at it and the observation made was it's a power steering issue that only manufacturer can correct due to the complexity. the trw is a non serviceable unit. enclosing i ask that you please contact the manufacturer and look into the facts of this matter which is fault of the manufacturer. i thank you in advance for your time and help with this matter."
front collision warning and brakes did not engage when this safety mechanism has been functioning in the past. we were driving on the freeway in traffic when the truck ahead of us braked suddenly. our pacifica rear-ended this vehicle at about 25-30mph. no audible or visual front collision warning occurred and the automated emergency braking system did not engage.
"power steering is not working at startup sometimes. get a message on the dashboard about ""electronic steering assist fault"". restarting the engine solves the issue.  why is this car not under the recall?  it fits the description of the recall for this make model and year.  it does not have the v6 engine."
"electric power steering assist is throwing faults, making the car undriveable.  recalls have been issued for other ford models with this epsa system.  last car checkup returned no fault messages (car was serviced for new tires and point inspection last week of june 2018).  the fault usually occurs on initial startup.  per the user manual, upon a fault occurring you shut off the car and wait 10 seconds for the power system to reset, then re start the car.  usually the fault will go away but now it is more persistent.  the fault will not go away by driving it off.  this is an expensive roughly $1500 repair that should not be happening. most reports point to a faulty sensor.  fault message automatically shuts off the epsa regardless of if it is mechanically sound or not, which is very dangerous if driving on the highway or busy downtown streets.  risk of accident is dramatically increased with this fault."
"after reaching 43,000 miles. the epas light came on and was unable to steer safely. 6 hrs from home. currently getting repaired total bill is $2000. i was driving , pulled over to get gas, killed the engine, got the fuel, started it back up and thats when the light came on for the steering assist fault. this is a safety hazard. there is multiple issues online about this happened. a recall was created on earlier year models but not this one. why???"
"upon starting the car and backing out of the driveway i experienced a loss of power steering assist. even with several attempts to turn the engine off and restart, the code is still there. there have been many cases of this happening online and a recall that my vehicle was not under in 2015."

"while driving the vehicle has lost power steering assist and stabilitrak intermittently on multiple occasions.  alerts flash on the screen and warning lights illuminate and ofcourse the steering will jerk back from a turn (if you're actively in one).  fortunately, i have taken photos in the past and actually had it occur on my way to an oil change today.  they checked the code it comes back to ""c0545"" which can be found on gm bulletin ""pit5437b"" that identifies this problem back in september 2015.  the cherolet service technician who diagnosed this on my vehicle informed my service department adviser that the vehicle is not safe with the problem, which of course was relayed back to me.    so, if a problem chevy identified in 9/15 makes a vehicle unsafe to operate, why does chevrolet want me to pay $1700 + tax instead of including my vehicle in the recall that addressed the same issue (nhtsa campaign number: 16v054000)?"

"recently had the power steering unit replaced by fca (50% my cost) and filed a nhtsa complaint. after approx 2,000 miles has developed very stiff and jerky steering assist. wheel will not return to center when you let go, and turning corners is a two handed, reduced speed affair as not to collide with other vehicles. i have determined that the universal joint on the steering shaft is bad. i can spray lubricant on it and the problem goes away for a while then returns as it dries out. *tt"

"what do you do when your steering wheel suddenly fails to control your car while you are driving?    with the steering wheel cranked as far as it would go, my car continued going straight as i pulled into a parking lot. i stopped the car completely, blocking traffic. then i slowly drove forward with no control over steering. thankfully, the car ended up in a suitable parking space, but not due to my efforts. i had no means with which to aim the car.    all i could do was call for someone to go get me. one day earlier, this car was on an interstate driving at 70 mph. i shudder to think about the harm this would have caused if it had happened 24 hours earlier!    ford's online documentation refers to ""loss of steering assist."" that's not what happened. i lost all control over steering with a steering wheel that moves easily in any direction but with no effect on where the car is going.    there was no warning of any kind when this happened."

"on aug 13, 2018 i went to the tesla service center in seattle and requested an appointment to have several recalls done, including seatbelts, takata airbags, and aluminum steering bolts.  i was told in no uncertain terms by service manager kasi smith, that my car is blacklisted by tesla since it has a rebuilt title.  that in order for the recalls to be done i must get the car ""recertified"" at a cost of between $5,000 to $32,000, depending on whether repairs are needed.    so i called tesla's national customer service line (877.798.3752) and reached louis escobar at tesla's burbank, ca location.  after he checked with the seattle service center (which i'd already told him refused me) and with his supervisor, hunter carlson, mr. escobar informed me that  my car is blacklisted by tesla since it has a rebuilt title, and in order for the recalls to be done i must get the car ""recertified"".    my car was professionally rebuilt, and has been registered with the state of washington and i've been driving it for two years.      if we can all agree that wrecked cars are -going- to be rebuilt, then what should tesla's policy be? i should think they'd want to protect their reputation and ensure the safety of their customers.    so for recert do they charge high fees and take away all benefits that were paid for on purchase of the car, like navigation, autopilot, and supercharging?  well the cost alone forces those of us with rebuilt cars to drive around with no inspections, except those done by the state patrol, which are only checking that we did not use stolen parts.    so clearly their goal is not to protect their reputation and ensure the safety of their customers. what is the goal then? make money?"

"on two separate occasions in the last month, during key on/startup/initialization, i will get an adaptive cruise control/aeb/lane keeping system failure.  this is due to a fault in the camera module.  adaptive cruise control still works above 20 mph indicating that the failure is in the camera module.  failure is latched for the key cycle and but will recover after a long key cycle.  1st time the failure set, it was very warm out so i believed this was due to an overheat.  the second time the failure set the temperature was in a normal range so my hypothesis is wrong.  no unusual situation is occurring at startup except the failure.  have not taken to the dealer yet."

steering gets very tight at times at all speeds. suspected that electronic steering assist mechanism is bad. this part was recalled in 2015 for failures.
the power steering assist stops working and it is almost impossible to steer this has happened on 2 occasions in the last 3 months. the dash displays a power assist fault but there are no obd codes. this had a recall which i had the car in for and since it has happened a total of 3 times since. these have all occurred at low speed and the only way to clear it is to turn the car off and restart.
my car is having a steering assist fault. almost half a million similar vehicles recalled for the same issue but ford won't fix this under recall.
"the problem started while driving at highway speed.  i can best describe it as a ""stickiness"" at about 5 degrees off center.  there was a noticeable ""catch"" where it would become difficult to turn and i would have to force the wheel to keep turning.  this very distracting at highway speeds, and potentially dangerous.  in the following weeks, the problem has gotten worse, to include intermittent shuddering, that feels like driving over rumble strips, squeeking and clicking at low speeds, and if locking the steering out in one direction or another the wheel will ""jump"" back.  upon further investigation, this seems linked to the electronic power steering assist, which though it hasn't failed completely, is definitely failing.  after reading other similar complaints, i no longer feel safe driving this vehicle with my three kids, and am not willing to pay the $2,600 repair price for a vehicle that is only 2 and a half years old.  i am now back to driving my 12 year old truck, which while it has it's own problems, at least it is safe."

"product safety recall 17276 loss of steering assist -- my truck is not involved in this recall, but i am having the exact issues described in the recall, sudden loss and return of eps assist. this happens at low speeds when turning or backing, both forward and reverse motions.    i am also having issues with the cruise control shutting off intermittently when activating the turn indicator to change lanes. i understand that this may be related to this recall, as the electrical software issues can cause other electrical systems to become temporarily disabled, such as the radio, stabilitrack, dic, chimes, door-lock cycling, air conditioning, or cruise control. also, when the turn indicator is activated and the cruise control shuts off, the dash lights also flicker.    i have already had this truck in to the dealer once to fix this, and they refused to run the recall because my truck was not in the recall group. instead they charged me over $1,000 to replace a steering wheel position sensor, which i now doubt was the problem since the issues with loss of steering and disabling of cruise control have returned. i just want this fixed."

"bought this car - had less than 2 years and the transmission failed twice.  the transmission issues were covered under a recall.  steering assist fault/malfunction was happening.  you'd shut the car off and turn it back on and it would fix itself.  the steering assist fault come one while my daughter was driving and she could no longer steer the vehicle.  thank god she wasn't involved in a car accident and was close to our house.  this seems to be a well-known defect in the ford cars and ford is offering no help to fix the issues.  they are going to get sued because, sadly, this defect is going to end up killing someone.  they are lucky my daughter wasn't hurt.  this steering issue should be recalled.  lives are at risk and no one seems to care (especially ford!).  now ford wants $2,500 to fix this defect.  i don't think so!  ford will not get another red cent from me, ever!  their steering defect could have cost my daughter her life!  i'm ready for a class action lawsuit.  i'm ready to fight!  what is it going to take to get this defect recalled?  an innocent life, maybe two?  what?  everyone is put on notice that there is a serious malfunction with this car and i know ford already knows about it.  they've had issues with steering in their other vehicles that have been recalled and they've had 100s+ (if not more) of complaints with this vehicle in particular regarding the steering.  ford turning a blind eye is completely unacceptable!"

car has power steering assist fault and is manual steering now. driver is almost 80 and can not drive now due to this. too hard to turn wheel. either he drives or a woman with a child drives it. either way it is dangerous because it is too hard to steer. fault has come up numerous times but would go away by restarting the car but will not go away this time. multiple years of this model have been recalled due to this issue but this year of the same car with the same power steering assist fault has not been recalled. dealer wants to charge 1800.00 to repair when this year should have been recalled too since it is the same issue that caused a recall for other years of the same car. the power steering assist fault has always come up when driving the vehicle which is dangerous
"electric power steering assist system intermitently fails upon start-up of the vehicle creating a ""power steering fault' warning message in the driver interface system. after turning off the vehicle and restarting it after 30 seconds, the power steering system continues to fail. the failure also continues while the vehicle is in motion. failure causes a shutdown of the power steering assist causing difficulty of control and steering at low speeds, increasing the liklihood of a crash. failure of the power steering system also creates a cascading failure in the advanced traction control system, also resulting in a warning message and reduced safety. this problem is extremely similar to the problem described in nhtsa campaign number 14v286000 and ford recall number 14s06. upon searching for this vin however, it appears that ford has not included this specific vehicle under the recall even though it has exhibited the same problems."

"the automatic steering stopped working while my daughter was driving on a busy city street 30 mph last night.  as she slowed and tried to correct, she was unable to avoid a collision as a result.  this is the second time this has occurred to a second daughter.  after investigating this issue following the most recent iss, it is obvious that ford was negligent during the recall repair.   ford recalled this safety issue, but only updated software rather than fixed the issue.  this was a design failure by ford putting people, including my daughters at risk.  people have indicated that this repair will cost between $3,500 and $5,000.  as this was identified as a previous potential failure due to the ford engineering deficiency, how can they be exonerated from responsibility."

"while taking the kids to school, i was making a left turn across a busy road when, without warning, the vehicle stopped turning, made an alarm sound and seemed to decrease power. i was able to complete the turn just before oncoming traffic arrived at the intersection. as the wheels straightened out, the power steering returned to normal. as i made the next right hand turn, it again cut out in mid-turn and the 'power steering assist fault' message flashed on the dash. during the next left-hand turn, it again cut out mid-turn but this time i was expecting it and had no trouble forcing the vehicle to complete the turn. this time the fault message stayed on and there was no longer any power assist. i drove the vehicle to a parts store expecting it to be a problem with the power steering pump or a low fluid issue only to discover in the owners manual that the power assist is electrical, not hydraulic. i asked the parts store employee to run a scan on the vehicle and when he saw the vehicle/message he told me the scan wouldn't do any good with that issue and it was going to be a very expensive trip to the mechanic. when i turned the vehicle back on, the 'power steering assist fault' message stayed on without any power steering. when i arrived home, i researched the issue and found that there are recalls for 2010 ford escapes from the kansas city plant, but a check of the ford recall database shows no such recall for my specific vehicle. on a vehicle with only 96,823 miles, i would not expect a critical safety component to unexpectedly fail. this vehicle is normally driven by my girlfriend (who actually owns the vehicle) and while i was able to complete the turn in those conditions without an accident, i am not certain she would have been able to do so."

"i bought this 2018 f150 lariat new, on test drive i noticed vehicle did a lot of weaving to the point i asked salesman to drive it back and verify if steered like his 2017 which he did.     this vehicle drifts all over the road and feels like it is getting over run with electrical impulses in the steering causing it to drift left and right constantly and at it's will, if you look down to adjust the heater controls it will be across the centerline or off the shoulder immediately, and there are a lot of complaints about his from owners.    my dealership has aligned the front end and it is correct, the best we can tell it is in the electric steering, and not to be confused with lane assist which is never turned on, it has to do with the epas and the driftt control/crown in the road conditions. it feels like this system is constantly creating road conditions in it's mind and working the steering to correct for what is not there. ford has an algorithm built in and it is not working and needs to be turned off immediately and correct this steering issue.    to tell you how bad it is passing 3 cars the other day at 70mph crossing into the passing lane the truck had some kind of hiccup and the steering steered hard right and i almost lost control of the vehicle, it almost snapped the truck sideways, nobody was very happy with this.  going down the road slowly on a flat surface you can feel the impulses or the steering wheel/tires oscillating ever so slightly back and forth, hook a trailer to this truck and you have a swaying beast on your hands.    this steering system is very dangerous, not 100% sure what is going on but it drifts constantly back and forth, nobody wants to drive this truck, you start to pass you do not know what to expect out of the steering, dealership is ready to help but ford knows it is a problem with alot of their 2018's, waiting on ford for a fix!"
upon ignition a message 'steering assist fault svc required' sometimes appears and the steering wheel is extremely difficult to turn. problem is usually remedied by turning off the engine and restarting but can sometimes take three tries. problem was intermittent but is becoming more frequent. so far it only happens when the vehicle is parked on level ground and slightly inclined driveways. online research suggests bad placement of the steering module is causing internal electronics to overheat and develop faults.

"when driving the vehicle regardless of speed or driving condition the traction control system randomly activates (it is always when going around a curve, but road conditions are dry, speed could be 70 or could be 20, there is no loss of control by me as a driver). this causes the car to abruptly brake. the computer system shows no issues when the dealer looks at it. when i deactivate the traction control system using the button the van will still beep loudly indicating a loss of traction control. it will also kick off the cruise control, but does not activate the automatic braking feature. this has been happening daily for 2 months with multiple visits to repair shops."
when i am starting my car i get a message that says steering assist malfunction service required and i can not turn my steering wheel at all.
"the adaptive cruise control in this vehicle has several operational issues (programming bugs or defects) which are potentially extremely hazardous.     perhaps the most potentially dangerous behavior of the system is as follows:    - when using adaptive cruise control, the system automatically accelerates and applies braking force to stay a set distance (one of three distances) from the nearest preceding vehicle.   - when the nearest preceding vehicle changes lanes, the system can become confused, display ""no preceding vehicle"" and disengage.   - this behavior can be dangerous or life-threatening in some cases, which i've experienced several times:    what happened:  - highway driving at 65mph, using adaptive cruise control and following another vehicle.   - we approach an area of congestion or stopped vehicles (a traffic jam).  - the preceding vehicle begins quick deceleration in order to avoid rear-ending the vehicle in front of it.  - my adaptive cruise control also applies strong braking to maintain its programmed distance  - the preceding vehicle changes lanes out of my lane  - my adaptive cruise control displays ""no preceding vehicle"" and disengages, which means that it stops braking  - my car is now flying into the vehicle in front of me, giving me only a moment to react and apply braking.     instead of disengaging during braking, the adaptive cruise control should continue braking down to a speed of 25mph, which is the maximum speed that toyota's safety stop operates at to bring a car to a complete stop.     the current behavior of the system has led to several near accidents in my highway driving, and is undoubtedly a danger to anyone else who uses a toyota adaptive cruise control of this model on the highway.    i reported this issue to toyota last year and they seem uninterested in fixing it, refusing even to convey my report to their developers in japan."

the steering has a dead spot in the center which causes wandering in the lane and over correction at 40 mph and up to highway speeds. this causes unsafe lane keeping on country roads as well as highway and interstate travel. both my wife and i have nearly side swiped vehicles and close calls in oncoming traffic. the dealer in my location says it's normal behavior but the ability to stay in my lane is not safe in any way.

"the car ran out of brake fluid - there was an indicator and when taken to service we were told the reservoir was empty.  what is alarming is that the car is serviced very frequently and one set of brakes was recently replaced (about 6 months).  moreover the dealer stated there was no leak.  they stated that they do not replenish the brake fluid when replacing pads, in essence, because the fluid system is so fragile and they are afraid they will do more harm than good.  it seems like a straightforward proposition that if the brakes are checked and pads replaced frequently, and there is no leak, there should be no possible way for the fluid to go empty absent a defect in the car (excess fluid consumption for some reason besides a leak) or faulty maintenance procedures.  i believe the practice of not replenishing brake fluid - described to me as the normal practice at mercedes service, not a 1-time mistake - is negligent.  contributing factors include (1) mercedes brakes are known to wear very quickly (roughly annual brake pad change); (2) the 2014 model adaptive cruise system tends to apply the brakes very often, i.e. unintelligent algorithm that uses brakes continually while cruising at 70 mph on freeway, not something a human would ever do"

"the vehicle cruise control picks up speed when going down hill.  the honda dealership stated that the vehicle is a base model and does not have adaptive cruise control, therefore, according to them, is working as designed.  the ""design"" has a serious safety flaw as the driver must constantly be aware of the terrain and speed of the vehicle which seems to negate the use of a cruise control.  i experienced several frightening situations while on a road trip from yellowstone national park to seattle this summer.  the car was gaining as much as 20-30 mph on steep, mountainous terrain resulting in dangerous speeds.  i discontinued use thinking that this ""feature"" was malfunctioning.  i can not believe the dealer's response that the cruise control was working as designed is in the interest of public safety or the truth.  i was left with no other recourse but to file this report."

"adaptive cruise control (acc) issues  scenario 1  first day  i was traveling at approximately 70 mph. as i would in any of my other 100 + cars i've owned, i held the cruise control 'set' button expecting the speed to gradually decrease. the impala much to my surprise, with traffic behind me, went from 70 mph to approximately 20 mph within 7 secs. the traffic behind me was swerving to avoid crashing into me.  it clearly states on page 182 of the owner's manual 'reducing speed while acc is at a set speed.  'press and hold setuntil the desired lower speed is reached, then release it.  when you hold the set button the speed drops so rapidly there is no possible way you could reduce the speed to only (for example) to 58 mph.  scenario 2  i was following a vehicle with the acc set.  vehicle ahead of me signaled to make a right turn and was merging right to make the turn.  as i proceeded to change lanes and go around the vehicle, my impala slammed on the brakes causing the vehicle behind me to have to swerve to avoid a crash.    scenario 3  referring to the scenerio 2. when the vehicle turning right cleared the camera on my impala the impala accelerated aggressively as though i was attempting to pass someone.  it was very unexpected and to the point where i felt i could lose control of the vehicle.  scenario 4  when rounding a curve if the acc camera senses a vehicle moving in a parking lot near the road it again brakes harshly for no good reason. again causing the vehicles behind me to have to react. the impala will again accelerate aggressively once past the moving car in the parking lot.  scenario 5  in two lane traffic with the acc set, when you're rounding a corner if the camera of the acc gets the car in the other lane in its vision the impala will again slam on the brakes.  when the car in the other lane is out of the camera range the impala accelerates rapidly.

"on nov 17, 2018 at 4:50 pm, i was driving my tesla x slowly with auto pilot off and auto steer off on a surface street in san clemente, ca. i was trying to do a u turn. i verified that there was no traffic, that there was an area where cars were not parked on the left side of the street and could use a parking driveway on the right that will allow more space to perform the u turn. i gently pressed the break to further slowdown and then veered a little to the right into the driveway at less than 5 mph. i started to turn to the left while still gently pressing the break. as soon as the front right wheel left the driveway and before i had completed the u turn, the tesla all of a sudden, on its own spontaneously accelerated to full power (a tesla x can go from 0-60 miles in approx. 4 seconds). my foot was still on the break, i did not move it and therefore i did not press the accelerator. there were no objects obstructing the pedals. in a small fraction of a second, the tesla traveled at full speed towards the tacoma car parked ahead on the left (less than 20 feet). something in the tesla system triggered the sudden spontaneous full acceleration resulting in this collision.  the tesla had major damage in the front, the air bags were deployed. i had a major bruise on my abdomen and several small bruises on my chest. the tacoma suffered damage in the front, moved backwards and hit the car parked behind it. there were no passengers in the other vehicles. it is my firm belief that this accident occurred due not to a driver's error but to a technological error within the tesla vehicle. i found more than 60 complaints for spontaneous sudden acceleration for tesla vehicles that have been filed to nhtsa. what these complaints have in common are that vehicles are traveling slowly trying to park or make turns at low speed when sudden spontaneous full acceleration was triggered."

while driving lost power steering and got power steering assist fault code
the automatic emergency braking system activates on the highway for reason. i have been to the dealer repeatedly during the warranty period and they can't fix the problem. it activates at times with nobody in front of me and sometimes with a clear lane ahead of me and a truck next to me. this has happened numerous times since i bought the vehicle three years ago.
"drove vehicle 15 miles to destination and then another 15 miles back home without incident. parked and fully turned vehicle off and went inside the house.  returned to the vehicle 6 minutes later and upon inserting key and starting vehicle got the message power steering assist fault and the steering wheel was near impossible to turn.  returned to the house to google the error and to my surprise found that this was a common issue for this make, model and year and had resulted in a large recall.  unfortunately, this vin# was not included in this recall. i am hoping someone can provide an explanation as to why it is not included as this is certainly a safety issue.  what happens when the driver is turning left against traffic and the steering goes out?  or a child or pedestrian is injured (or worse) as a result of the steering locking up.  clearly there is manufacturer liability here."

"hello nhtsa administrator,    i bought a new hyundai genesis in march 2010. around august 2010, i had a small fender bender in the parking lot. to keep warranty intact on the car, hyundai insisted that the wiring harness on the car be replaced, which i did for approximately $5000. since then, i have had multiple electronic items go bad in the car. i replaced some of these at my own expense. but the problem has gotten worse with some expensive electronic components going bad over the last 2 years.     in normal circumstances, these components should not go bad over the life of the car, and certainly not at a frequency that they have failed in my car. i attribute these failures to bad/defective job done during wiring harness replacement. but hyundai has refused to accept responsibility since the car is out of warranty.    below is a list of the bad components, approximate date of the component going bad, whether it is replaced/fixed and approximate expense to fix them    1. telescopic steering wheel--2015--repaired as part of warranty  2. power switch assembly driver's seat--jan 2016--$236.19--paid out-of-pocket to get it replaced  3. jog dial assembly--oct 2016--$1031.70--paid out-of-pocket to get it replaced  4. front cabin dome light assembly--feb 2017--$376.91--paid out-of-pocket to get it replaced  5. smart cruise control--mar 2017--not replaced--dealership gave me a quote of ~$4500 to replace  6. passenger cabin dome light assembly--aug 2017--not replaced--$4500 estimate to replace  7. multi disc cd player--feb 2018--not replaced--$1000 estimate to replace      i would like nhtsa to investigate hyundai for this matter and force them to pay for repairs. as a consumer, i feed cheated and being forced to double pay for repairs - once for the wiring harness replacement and now for all problems attributed to it.    sincerely,  [xxx]    information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6).  *tr"

"i don't seem to understand how this issue has not been an official recall yet directed by the nhtsa.  out of 3806 (as of dec 20 2018) there are 1024 strictly related to steering.    i as well as so many other ford owners have fallen victim to the failing of the electronic power steering assist.  went out to go to work last night and power steering assist fault"" continues to display, restarting vehicle does not seem to fix as others have stated.  am glad this did not occur while driving as has happened in other reports.    i am seriously questioning as others have if it is going to take an accident that kills someone before this investigation is taken seriously.  from what i can see its somethings that has been well known since this time last year, yet people continue to have it fail, and nothing is done on fords part.  they just keep collecting money from people that have no other option than to have them fix it.  once the dealer opens i am going to be having to get the car towed to the dealer to have issue resolved, and i'm sure be quoted the $1,500-1,800 that others have been quoted, as well as be told ""we haven't heard anything about this"" until i mention all the reports, much like my door handle that broke, and wasn't until i talked to a different customer support agent that it actually was well known.  what i'm seeing is issues which are very common, affecting hundreds to thousands of owners, but ford continues to says its not their problem, it hasn't been recalled so we must pay to get it fixed and be on our way.  honestly thinking as others that even as happy as i have been in the past with ford, it will probably not be my vehicle of choice come time to buy a new car as recently issues that should be getting addressed are consistently not being addressed."

"on october 18, 2018 i received the power steering assist failure error on my instrument panel when turning on my vehicle. i had driven it earlier in the day without issue. previously i had the occasional warning noise and quick flash of an error (too quick for me to read all the way) and would have momentary difficulty turning. this issue makes it almost impossible to steer the vehicle. research indicates that it is most likely a malfunctioning torque sensor. i reached out to ford after learning of recalls for the 2009 model year. i was informed that my vin was not included in the recall. ford was unwilling to assist with the cost of repairs in any way. their suggestion was to keep the receipt on the slim chance that the recall would be expanded. this is unacceptable. had i been on a highway when this occurred it could have been fatal to myself or others. this repair will cost in the neighborhood of $1000 or more. i will need to have the work done at a dealership to ensure the repair is done correctly and that ford won't give me reimbursement issues should the recall be expanded.     this occurred less than a year after the fuel inlet valve failed on the vehicle, causing it to shut down while driving and rendering it unable to be started.     the rear hatch has not been able to be opened for over three years because of an issue with the latch.    i have had issues with the climate control system and well. there were issues with air conditioning when i purchased the vehicle (april 2015). the issues were not apparent previous to purchase because of the weather at the time. within a month the weather warmed up. when i attempted to use the a/c it was only blowing hot air. the dealership was willing to fix the issue free of charge because of the circumstances. however, the issue is occurring again even after having an a/c recharge performed."

"this is an issue that has been continuously happening since i purchased the vehicle with about 2500 miles on it, it currently has about 6500 miles on it. the emergency braking system continues to turn on and off at various times but has continued to get worse over the few months that i have owned it. the worst situation i have had was recently on a 300 mile round trip when the emergency braking would activate and deactivate every few minutes, in which it would flash on the dash saying the system was obstructed, and the warning light showing it deactivated would turn on, the cruise control would shut off and a keeping sound would turn on. this was happening with no apparent particular incident. the trip took some back roads, a lot of highway (2 lane and 4 lane) and a moderate in city driving. the weather was clear, the sun was out with partial clouding, it was around 40 degrees outside, the roads were dry, some were rough some smooth, other than in the city there was little stop and go traffic. the worst incident was during the return trip, we were on a 2 lane highway that was pretty smooth. there was no one in front of us we were doing approximately 70mph with traffic behind us, we had the cruise control on and were just going along a straight flat stretch of road when the system once again deactivated, beeped then reactivated and beeped and then slammed on the brakes on us. it was only an instant and created no situation of danger based on our position, and as it was instant i was able to step on the gas again and we only dropped from 70 to about 50mph in the period. this was the worst situation i have run into with the issue so i looked it up on the internet and found it is stated as an issue on the sentra. this unexpected deceleration on a freeway could have been a devastating accident."
"while making a right hand turn, my escape seemed to lose power and was veryt hard to make the turn.  got out of the turn and it seemed fine but the  power steering assist fault showed up on the dash. the next turn i made, it did it again!    i googled it and it showed there was recalls for this exact same fault.  edmunds report 5-29-14 stated ford recalls 1.1 million vehicles for power steering problems, including 2008-'11 ford escape, 2011-13' ford explorer.   i took my 2009 ford escape to the ford dealer to have them look at it.  they ran my vin number and comes up as no recall!  they explain to me that they have ran into this problem before.  that some of the recalls don't apply to all vehicles listed in recalls.  i told the dealer how could this be?  they offered me to call ford directly at 1-800-392-3673...i will call this number once done with this vehicle safety complaint.  it's a very good thing i was taking  my daughters car today to go and put gas in it when this happened.  if she was driving it, i'm not sure she would of been able to turn the steering wheel when this went out on me.  no telling what could of happened and thank god she wasn't driving!"

"i have 28,452 miles on my car and the power steering went out.  i get a warning which says steering assist fault service required, terrain management system fault, and service advance trac errors upon starting my vehicle.  in researching these errors, it seems to be a very common problem with ford explorers and a costly one to fix.  i believe this to be a manufacture defect, due to the sheer number of similar complaints and low mileage.  in addition, this is a huge safety problem if one was traveling down the road which also seems to happened."
"while driving home on my birthday at highway speeds the power steering noticeably failed. a message on the dashboard read ""loss of electrical steering assist"".  i was close to home and near my exit, and was able to steer the vehicle home without power steering.  at higher speeds it was barely tolerable, as i was not switching lanes; but in an emergency i would not have been able to. at slower speeds making turns was extremely difficult, and i am a man with strong arms.   had this occurred on a busy highway or congested road, the outcome could have been much worse for me and others around me.  this is an extremely dangerous fault that has been recorded in similar gm trucks and recalls should be mandated for what may well be a very expensive fix if out of warranty. estimated at over $2000."

"tl* the contact owns a 2012 ford fusion. while shifting the vehicle into gear, the steering wheel seized. the contact placed the vehicle into reverse and could not turn the steering wheel once it was backed out into the street. a message stating ""steering assist fault service required"" appeared on the instrument panel. the dealer was not contacted, but the contact planned to make an appointment with rochester ford (4900 us-52, rochester, mn 55901, (507) 288-7564). the manufacturer was not notified. the failure mileage was 108,000.

power steering assist fault  happens while driving  recall should be extended to cover more vehicles
"i was taking on off-ramp from the freeway and mid-turn my power steering stopped working and it felt like the wheel locked up. luckily i was able to brake and stop before going off of the roadway. dash indicator messages displayed ""power steering assist fault"" and ""service advancetrac"". the car is absolutely unsafe to drive in this condition and could have easily caused a crash as it happened mid-turn when exiting the freeway. in doing some research, i understand the 2011 mercury milan and ford fusions have both been recalled for this electronic power steering module failure. my 2010 milan uses the exact same assembly and the repair cost is significant as i've received quotes ranging from $1600-2100. my 2010 milan has less than 63,000 miles and it is unacceptable to expect the owner to pay these repair costs on a vehicle with such low mileage. please review the problem and extend the recall to include 2010 models which at this point would allow me to be reimbursed for the costs of the repair. i have no choice but to repair the vehicle and this creates a significant hardship on my family as well as any other people who experience the issue. especially considering it is a known defect on the 2011 and 2012 model years. in talking with ford corporate and my local dealership i understand that the nhtsa must issue the recall, not ford themselves. i am sickened by this problem and can only hope the nhtsa will do the right thing and extend the recall to cover my vehicle."
"power steering assist went out. had drove in frigid temps from home to work just fine, parked for one hour in parking lot, when i went to leave , had no power steering. message pop up , ""service..power steering assist. "" could barely steer-turn truck moving at slow speed. snow on so had to drive slow. very dangerous. went 10 miles to dealership and left it to be checked. would not be able to control it on my curvy road home."
"tl* the contact owns a 2009 chevrolet malibu. when the vehicle was started, the steering wheel seized and the power steering assist and traction control warning indicators illuminated. the contact called bomnin chevrolet manassas (8000 sudley rd, manassas, va 20109, (703)-368-2111) and was informed that the vehicle was not included in a recall. the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired and the failure recurred. the manufacturer was made aware of the failure and informed the contact that there were no recalls or warranties. the failure mileage was 100,006."
while driving on paved road not turning steering assist fault light came on.
"no power steering upon starting vehicle in driveway,  power steering assist fault code appeared in dash,  no power steering, unable to operate vehicle"
"i was driving my vehicle at 25 when it started showing three warnings "" collision mitigation system failure, lane departure system failure, adaptive cruise control failure (see your dealer). i called my local hnda dealership in reading pa. they said they have received alot of these complaints and they think they honda sensing system just freezes in the winter. it only snowed 5 inches a day prior to this event. basically they said it will go away once its bit warmer and they have no factory recall. all the dealership could repeat "" we are sorry"". i looked all over the internet and i found 100s of similar complaint. my question is why they are not fixing it? why there has been no recall? the failure of this honda sensing system defeats the main reason i bought this car along with many others."
when i was resuming adaptive cruise control the vehicle took off after a semi tractor trailer that was in front of me; i had to brake hard to avoid from hitting the semi truck. i was traveling about 55 mph at the time this incident happened & it has happened two more times after that initial incident. then it stopped working and i had to take it in to the dealership. they said there was no recall on the vehicle & did a recalibration on the front camera & long range radar modules.
steering assist failure    it seems that there have been problems and recalls with this steering issue however the dealership will not address the problem
"the vehicle was parked turned on lost power steering and posts the codes ""power steering assist fault"" and ""advancetrac needs service."" it makes controlling the car difficult and dangerous. we checked online and noticed there have been hundreds if not thousands of the same complaints. ford knows this is a problem on this model car and has done nothing about it. very dangerous and disappointing.  not a good representation of an american company."
"the car was in motion on a city street. the power steering assist just suddenly went out. which made it impossible to turn. i was lucky there was no traffic at that moment, very dangerous! this is the second time. i bought this 2010 fusion in 2013. i have already replaced the power assist once. now this happened again!?"
"steering assist failure without warring. system diagnostics indicate no issues - but the car steering has fault.  per service adviser, the cost for repair is going to be between $1,500 and $2,000.  based on what i have read on line, ford has issued a recall - however, it does not apply to 2013 ford escape - even though the part affected is exactly the same."
"tl* the contact owns a 2019 honda cr-v. while driving 70 mph, the vehicle shook, vibrated, and began to decelerate. also, the electric parking brake, transmission, brake system, brake hold, adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation system, road departure mitigation system, blind spot information system, and auto high beam system warning indicators illuminated. the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. the dealer and manufacturer were not contacted. the approximate failure mileage was 800. "
"vehicle running, both driving and stationary, dash indicated three warnings: ""adaptive cruise control system problem"", ""collision mitigation braking problem"", ""road departure mitigation problem"". all three systems were nonfunctional. dealer advised to drive through a car wash before coming in for repair. the car wash appears to have worked, but this is absurd! every time it rains or car is dirty, the safety features don't work? didn't see this disclosure when i bought the car or when i paid for these features."
i was coming threw  the wv area  coming down a hill moving toward the   car tunnels.  just as i was coming down the hill the car incressined the speeds from 70 to 75 and then from there to 80. (adaptive cruise control)i tried to contact the car owners that i  rented from and they wouldn't provide any information are contact me back to make the report on the vehicle .
"while in motion on a city street at low speed near my home, the vehicle suddenly lost power steering assist. i returned to my home and parked. later, i restarted the vehicle and found that power steering was working normally. took truck to dealer, who diagnosed as faulty ""electric belt drive rack and pinion steering gear"", part # 84494275. estimate to repair was over $1800. refer to gm bulletin 18027 for additional info."
"while driving our 2014 ford explorer, the service steering assist warning light came on, then the acs fault warning light came on.  at that time, the power steering went out and the turn signals quit working properly.  the vehicle could still be steered manually by a physically stronger person, but not by the average person.  the vehicle was taken to the local ford dealership, where we were informed that a new rack and pinion would be needed.  the dealer service manager stated that this repair has been covered under a previous recall for 2011-2013 explorers, however, that my particular model was not covered.  after doing more research, the steering going out seems to be a common problem in all late model ford explorers.  i am concerned that if ford has not resolved this issue in later model explorers, there will be accidents resulting from this malfunction."
"i have already filed a complaint , #11173709, i am filing again because i wanted to add information to the original complaint but could not find how to do that. this is a 2013 model year car that was purchased new from the dealer in march 2015. the car has been on the road for less than four years and has only 34750 miles. the steering assist has failed, almost causing a fender bender in a parking lot. after researching this , it seems to be a known problem that ford has with several cars. the cost for repair has been estimated at 1800.00 plus tax from our local ford dealer. another concern i have is that i bought two of these cars at the same time and i am now waiting for the second cars steering to fail."
"steering wheel started making a clunk noise sometimes when turning.driving yesterday the steering got very stiff.parked the steering would be hard. there was a recall #14s05  may 29 2014.when i called ford they said my car is not on recall list. same problem eps -electric power steering assist,torque sensor in steering column or updated software needed.it's very hard to turn the wheel when driving. it should be on recall list .it's a safety hazard."
after getting off of work at 1130 pm i went out to warm up my truck. after bout five minutes i went back out to leave got in the truck began to go home . to my surprise not far down the road when i went to go around bin(corner) my steering had locked up and i could barely move it. luckily i didn't go off the road and didn't get into wreck or anything over this although it was still pretty scary. the dash would beep and flashed power steering assist fault. so i call someone to help me then get on my phone google in power steering assist fault and the year make and model of my truck and it shows me that there had been a recall on that product or whatever the case may be and this is obviously a repeated problem with this truck. tried talking to the ford people and not only were they rude but was told it wasnt their problem basically cuz the vin number did not show the recall and i can take it up with the dealership. how can they just do that? there are several complaints on the same thing and i could have very easily been hurt as well as anyone else with this problem.
"i was driving on auto pilot mode when i was going to make a right hand turn when in order to slow down at the traffic ahead of me, i applied the brakes but there was no brake action whatsoever.  this was not a panic situation, it was just normal braking.  when the brakes failed to actuate and the vehicle accordingly wasn't slowing down, in order to avoid hitting pedestrians or the vehicle in front of me, i swerved to the right and ended up hitting a tree.  i sustained injuries as a result of this accident and totaled my car. the problem was the failure of the tesla (2018 model 3)  brake system to work."
"pilot assist function disengages suddenly without warning. this is different from the expected operation where the system's steering assistance will go into standby upon losing lane marking inputs. while the system does occasionally enter normal 'standby' indicated by the green steering wheel icon turning grey, it also occasionally turns off entirely without warning (including auto throttle control), which is indicated only by an unexpected deceleration and by the steering wheel icon and following distance indicators both suddenly disappearing from the indicator panel. immediately attempting to reactivate pilot assist will usually result in an 'unavailable' indication; however, waiting about 10 seconds will usually result in being able to reactivate full pilot assist function. this happens both city and highway driving."
while driving the vehicle it lost power steering. warning lights came on stating   power steering assist fault  service advance trac   terrain management system fault  this is not new to ford explorers apparently there was a recall 2011-2014. my vehicle is a 2015. it is a shame that ford or natsa would allow this risk to continue. i encourage you to recall any vehicles in all years to prevent accidents. my vehicle has been in the shop for a week already and when they told me three other ford explorers were fixed last week for the same problem i gasped that this is not part of a recall.  
"my car experienced a power steering assist fault as i was driving on the city streets  this evening, causing me to lose control of my car.  it was very alarming to immediately be left without power steering when driving and trying to maneuver my way home safely."
"tl* the contact owns a 2012 ford f-150. while driving approximately 35 mph, the electronic power steering assist became inoperable. the contact performed a diagnostic test using an obd diagnostic tool; however, no fault codes were located. imperial ford (located at 8 uxbridge rd, mendon, ma 01756, (888) 814-8373) was notified of the failure. the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was not notified of the failure. the approximate failure mileage was 58,000.

"my nissan rogue 2018 has an issue with the forward collision avoidance. i started experiencing this problem as soon as i bought it in march 2018. the first time it happened was on a normal road, i was driving at about 40mph and just crossing an intersection the car emitted few beeps and slowed down for about 3 seconds and then went back to normal speed. after that episode i took the car back to the dealer on march 30th to check it. the result was that there was no error code and all was working as normal. i took the car back and the same issue happened few other times. when passing through that same intersection the same issue happened maybe other 5 times. it usually happens in intersections when passing below traffic lights. just 2 days ago on the 4th it happened inside a garage when i was going at 20 mph. i am seeing a lot of complaints on this and nissan is not doing anything. i like the car but i cannot keep it with this defect."
"my son was driving his 2018 honda civic sport hatchback on base as he is in the army national guard when he came to a bend in the road. he turned the steering wheel to the right, then heard and felt a pop and the car became unable to be steered in the direction that he was turning the steering wheel. the car went left even though he was trying to turn right into the bend. he went across the road and into a ditch causing significant damage to the vehicle. thankfully he was unhurt. there were others who witnessed this because he was driving in a military convoy at the time it occurred. the nhtsa has issued a recall #18v663000  for 2018-1017 honda civic's on sept. 27, 2018 for the power steering assist failure describing exactly what happened to my son; unfortunately, his vin has not been included in the recall. someone needs to investigate this. the insurance company and american honda have both been informed of this accident and an issue report was filed with honda by us detailing what happened. however, they will not pay to open up the power steering gearbox to see if the magnet on my son's car did in fact become dislodged as in the others. we would have to pay out of pocket to investigate and since we are losing a significant amount of money already because they've deemed the car totaled, we are unable to investigate it on our own. please investigate this to see if other vin numbers need to be included in this recall! my son could have been killed or he could have killed someone else because of this!"
"2017 tesla model s started to accelerate on its own over 100 mph, when traveling on highway around 70 mph, without autopilot engaged. as soon as it started to accelerate, the car took control over the steering wheel and drove into the guardrail on the left of the lane, then quickly steered to the right lanes and steered to the left again. slammed on the brake but did not work at all, and steering wheel did not respond. the car completely took control over traveling over 100 mph going zig-zag on three lane highway, finally came to a stop after hitting number of trees in the woods on the right side of the highway. the car is completely totaled."
nissan just released a customer initiative letter pertaining to the automatic emergency braking system that states the system may activate on its own causing the vehicle to stop suddenly. nissan apparently has a fix for it but it has to happen first. this system already had a program update applied to it and the system still deactivated itself after driving. there have been a lot of complaints on this system and it is still not fixed. *dt  manufacturer was contacted.*jb
"started vehicle to go to work and had no power steering. power steering assist fault service required box popped up. turned vehicle off and on, still faulted so i tried a few more times. put vehicle in reverse, backed up, then went forward. lost stabilatrac, went into menu and box was unchecked and i was unable to select it. also at the same time a collision warning fault appeared. looked down at the terrain management, there were no lights illuminated so i turned it. instant terrain management fault appeared. so now i have 4 box faults on the left display and two yellow stabilatrac lights on to the right, one says off with the symbol and the other just the symbol. tried unhooking battery, no luck. called ford dealership, made an appointment for 2 days later, the earliest. started vehicle up next day, nothing cleared. called tow company and told them to take it to the dealership and it can sit there. talked to service manager and sounds like they already had an idea i was going to be getting a new steering rack. i'm just glad i wasnt driving at high speeds like a lot of the other posts and how are a few years on recall when it seems to be all years from 2011 on up. vehicle is waiting for another day to get into the mechanics bay even though i already know it will be a 1500 to 2500 dollar repair. vehicle has 76k miles. dont get me started on the key fob. oh and it was -38 degrees with winchill."

"i was driving west on a four-lane road going 40-45 mph, no one in front of me, when suddenly the automatic emergency braking system engaged on its own without any warning, stopping the car immediately and abruptly, enough so it threw articles on my front seat into the floorboard. antilock brakes engaged at the same time shaking the car to a stop. thankfully no one was immediately behind me and thankfully i was not on an interstate going 70 mph!  took it into the dealership that day, they kept it overnight and they could not find anything wrong.  after reading that other 2016 sonatas had done the same thing, i told the dealership i did not feel safe driving the vehicle and did not want it any longer.  they referred me to hyundai corporate who denied my claim because testing came up with no defect, and i assume is going to put it right back out on the streets!!  i had no choice but to trade it in and get another hyundai, since i would not feel comfortable selling it outright to someone else knowing this had happened.  i am very disappointed with corporate for allowing this vehicle to remain on the roads when this is obviously not the first complaint like this in the 2016s."

"known issue with this vehicle that power steering assist will fail at times causing difficult hard steering, safety issue when driving. gm has several recalls and customer satisfaction fixes for this but would only cover half the cost to repair my vehicle. mine was stationary all 3 times this happened but there are several reports of this occurring while the vehicle is in motion. i feel that gm should have repaired this known problem at no expense to me. i have several pages of owners stating the same problem. this is a safety issue as it can happen at any time."
"while driving, the battery light on the dash illuminated, while the power assist steering no longer worked. the car could still drive and steer, but it was very difficult to turn. the power steering assist would intermittently come back on, and then go off again, making it extremely difficult to operate the car safely. in this condition, if there were a need to tuner the car suddenly, it would not be possible."

power steering assist fualt.. drove fine and the steering went out while driving during a turn. almost hit another car.this was a a state highway through town.
while driving power steering assist was lost which resulted in a dangerous driving condition.  recycling the ignition key resolved the problem for a day or two before repeating. it appears this vin is not applicable to the gm recall for this known problem.  recommendation to nhtsa is to reopen this recall and expand the vin range to include vehicles with this problem and not a select few just to save money.  this incident occurs whether driving at interstate speeds or just starting the car and anywhere in between.
i was driving my truck in a grocery store parking lot when a power steering assist warning can on an i lost steering. the steering wheel feels lock and thankfully i was not driving at highway speed. i googled this and have seen lots of complaints about the same issue resulting in accidents and loss of life. come on ford...

"blind spot assist camera is a distraction and flickers due to other vehicle headlights at night. huge distraction can be dangerous, not an effective safety feature. driver side window doesn't close. even after 5 attempts the driver side window starts to close and half way reopens. all windows close noticeably slower. dealership can't replicate issue so no repair. still have the issue, even when parked the window doesn't close."
"steering wheel sticks while driving at highway speeds.  first noticed on a long trip from virginia to nj and thought it was a one-time thing.  however, the problem continued on the return trip.  problem presents itself initially as the steering wheel seems ""frozen"" in place.  to correct the normal drift, driver must ""break"" the steering wheel free from the frozen position to correct the drift.  this is a continual condition as the steering wheel returns instantly to its frozen state and must be continually un-stuck during the duration of the trip - going from stuck to un-stuck back to stuck.  trip was made during cold, rainy, and sometimes lightly snowy conditions.  car is currently at dealership and is being driven home by technicians in an attempt to induce the fault.  turned off all systems suspected of affecting this condition - adaptive cruise control, honda sensing, land departure warning, etc.  problem exists whether these features are engaged or not.  the presence of this condition make me very uneasy about driving this car on the highway at 55+ mph as i don't know if the steering wheel is going to just lock up and not break free from its stuck condition."

"while driving on a major highway the power steering went out with eps failure error messages: ""steering assist fault service required"" and ""service advancetrac"" could not steer the vehicle effectively and needed to pull off the road. there were no warning signs or previous issues. no restart, battery disconnect or fix was/is available. took it to the dealership who recognized full steering rack/pinion failure at only 50,000 miles."
"on 2/14/19, i was driving on a city street in a straight line at approximately 40mph. the car ahead of me stopped. i stepped on the brake and instantly the dashboard warnings lit up - adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation braking system, road departure mitigation system, and the brake - and the brake did not work so i could not stop. i rear-ended the car in front of me doing significant damage to the front of my car. the warnings were still visible after the crash and i took pictures of the dashboard as best as possible. the warnings say something about system not working and to see a dealer. the same warnings appeared on 2/13/19 in the afternoon but disappeared on 2/14/19 in the morning. other warnings of safety systems not active have appeared due to ice/slush but then cleared when the sensors were cleared, but these new warnings are different. at least twice, maybe three times in the past few months, the car would suddenly brake and slow down with nothing in the road or in front of the car. my bluetooth connectivity worked fine for first 2-3 months but then stopped and i couldn't reconnect the phone over the past two months. it seems like more than one system/electronics problem and seems like the warnings appeared at the same time as the brake not working as if it was more than an alert but a system (systems) no longer functioning at all. the brake worked after the accident when the car was restarted."
at around 40-50 miles an hour the lane assist will periodically jerk the steering wheel to one side when there is a break in the lines painted on the road. i have had the car to the dealership over 8 times for this issue and they are unable to du[plicate the problem and therefore unable to do anything about it. they tell me to either turn the lane assist off (but i paid extra for the capability) or get used to it because that car is working within the manufacturers specifications.
while driving on city street going home an error message displayed 'steering assist fault - service required'. the car became very difficult to steer.  will be scheduling with mel hambelton ford to investigate the condition.
"it happened about once a month, i would have no power steering when in traffic, in motion, turning for about 3 - 5 seconds, then back to normal steering.  i didn't know about any recall at the time.  then while in motion, turning into traffic power steering stopped completely, with message ""power steering assist fault""  i looked online, and found out about the recall.  dealer says steering recall was completed but i was never notified when. the problem has never stopped for me.  now it is a permanent problem, and dealer says no warranty, no recall.  can i force the dealer to re-do the recall somehow?"
"steering assist suddenly stopped working on my 2009 ford escape. i stopped for lunch then cranked it and steering was extremely hard to turn.  ford dealership said  it is the torque assembly. i also noticed the seatbelt alarm had quit working and the clock needed reset. numerous issues with tire pressure sensors. there has been a terrible vibration or shaking in the steering wheel while stopped with foot on the brake since purchase. i also had problems in the steering column in 2011, just after purchase. there is a recall on the torque assembly for same year of car but not my vin, of course."
"on my way back to home in san diego ca in late jan 2019 the panel started showing warning signs like brake system light on, adaptive cruise control/road departure mitigation/lane keeping assist system (lkas) lights are all on saying failure. this was the second time for my around 2000 miles accord hybrid. the first time it was able to resolve by re-power on the car but second time it was completely failed. then i went back to dealer the other day and it turned out the multipurpose camera did not work properly under rain and low temperature (it was just typical san diego winter) so they replaced one. it is extremely dangerous since i have seen people reported the same issue everywhere. after the replacement the auto-highbeam started working as well, before i didnt even know it was not working. same warning sign like this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_nfu2hpngc"
"car is 2 weeks old and i've had the cmbs which controls the autobraking and adaptive cruise control go off 4 times with the failure warning and to see the dealer for inspection. each time was under a different set of environments including at night, a cloudy day, rain, and sunny. it seems to fail within 10 mins of the first time the adaptive cruise is set. the green light that indicates the system is working goes off and turns to orange. i've contacted the dealer for repair but online searching shows both dealers and honda do not have a fix."
"electric power steering assist works intermittently. car was manufactured 22 days prior to april 18, 2006 manufacture date for g6's covered under recall number 15v064000. sometimes won't work at engine start-up, then begins working; sometimes stops working while vehicle is in motion. unpredictable but power steering warning light comes on every time it occurs. has been recurring for several months. date specification below does not apply so i entered the last date of occurrence."
"after my ""brake system"" light came on and the dealership denied it even though i had record of it, my car decided to see how fast it could hit the brakes. i was driving on the us-60 in phoenix, arizona with adaptive cruise control on, traveling at 65 mph during morning rush hour, so it's still dark, on a 6 lane freeway. i can see brake lights far ahead, so i lightly tap my brakes to disengage acc and slightly slow the car down. the car had other plans and the brakes completely locked up like it was using the emergency braking for collision mitigation' but no warning/info showed on the dashboard as it normally does when emergency systems engage. so basically my car decided it wanted to slam on its brakes in the middle of a busy freeway, near bumper to bumper traffic, all because i lightly touched the brakes-- it was not abrupt, it was not a hard push... it was literally to turn off acc. i watched the rear view mirror as the suv behind me was about to put my trunk in the engine compartment, but thankfully they were able to swerve into the hov  lane next to us. they barely missed me and if that open spot was not there for them, i'd likely be seriously injured or dead.     honda has ignored my messages and it's time to let our government know this car has issues."
"i was driving slowed down to turn right onto my street ioss total control of my truck ended up on the side walk on the opposite side of road as i was not able to control my truck, my truck shut down completely while in drive, mydashboard started to display stabilitrack disabled, steering assistant reduced, two key programmed, open and close driver door. this is not the first time this has happened but the first time to this extreme that is why we had took our truck to vandergriff chevrolet in arlington tx  on 2/16/19 were they took care of the open recall and did a software reset for loss of steering assist c18289 and power steering control module but even after software reset i'm still having the same issue i'm taking my vehicle in again to be serviced as i find this loss of steering very dangerous thankfully no one was on that side walk that could've been seriously hurt. the other two times this happened prior to yesterday was when we were in a drive thru and we were turning to order food and once turning into my sons school again vehicle shut down completely while in drive all the warnings lights displaying."
"tl* the contact owns a 2011 mercury milan. the contact stated that the power steering was faulty and it required excessive force to steer. the failure almost caused the contact to crash into his front yard upon entering the driveway. the ""power steering assist"" message appeared on the instrument panel. the dealer and manufacturer were not contacted. the vehicle was not diagnosed or repaired. the failure mileage was 48,000. the vin was invalid."
"takara recall, while driving i had to make a turn. when turning, suddenly the steering was difficult to turn and i was forced to stop the car. i got the message  ""steering assist malfunction"". this was very scaring because i was in traffic and an accident could've happened."
"three separate incidents. all three incidents happened while first starting vehicle, putting vehicle in reverse, and then the steering wheel locks up and a steering assist failure warning comes on. steering wheel will not move. had to pull back in to parking spot and turn car off. upon turning the vehicle back on, the steering wheel is back to normal and the warning is gone. terrible vehicle. feel unsafe driving my child in it. never will buy another ford ever again."
"on saturday, february 16, 2019 while driving on a clear afternoon, we went onto the entry ramp for the highway to rt 95 s. the  ramp was not straight and had curves. when an attempt was made to apply the brakes to slow for the first curve, they did not respond as they should, they pulsed and locked. at the same time, the digital dash began displaying multiple warnings of systems not functioning including brake,  emergency brake, transmission, power steering, tire pressure, lane assist, cruise control, hill assist,, etc. with difficulty we were able to pull onto the grass shoulder of the highway, there was not a breakdown lane in view. we tried shutting the car off and restarting, and the warnings persisted.  i contacted honda assistance and they sent a tow truck. the tow driver stated he had difficulty loading the car because of the brakes being locked. at the honda dealership, they also could not release the brakes to off load the car."
"when i started my car this morning, a message appeared that said ""power steering assistant fault error"" i initially thought maybe it was because of the cold, but that was not the case.  i drove it to work, as i did not have any other choice. i made it to work safely, it was just hard steering at turns. i began to investigate as to the problem on the internet. it seems that there was a recall for this issue for the 2011 and later models. unfortunately this is not the best time for this to happen.  as i was reading this site, there are many others with the same year model fusion that also have had this issue. i would think that ford would consider to also offer to fix this problem on the 2010 modes as well, since they have had the recall on the 2011 models."
"loud clicking noise when driving speed of 50 mph or more on the interstate, suddenly loss of power steering control and hard to turn the wheel. took the car to my mechanic. he ran a diagnostic and confirmed that the steering colum coupling was completely destroyed and the power steering assist motor need replacing. researched found that this was investigated february 2017 tsb #5np-g5z6w-03 , however i did not receive a recall notice."
my son was driving home late one night along a busy freeway and all of the sudden the power steering failed. message on display says power steering assist fault. why was there no recall issued for the 2010 models and al the rest>??????   very upset with ford.
"tl* the contact owns a 2010 ford fusion. when the vehicle was started, the power steering assist failed warning message appeared on the instrument panel. the vehicle was towed to an independent mechanic who determined that the electronic rack and pinion and steering gear failed and needed replacement. the vehicle was not taken to the dealer for diagnostic testing. the manufacturer was not notified of the failure. the vehicle was not repaired. the approximate failure mileage was 113,000.

"relevant to nhtsa campaign number: 18v663000, our 2018 honda cr-v exhibited the behavior described in the recall notice resulting in accident (vehicle hitting telephone pole).  same make and model listed in the recall however the vin search does not return as part of the recall.    turning the steering fully to the right while exiting a car wash resulted in the 'steering assist' applying force in the opposite direction causing loss of control, collision and injury."
"after driving the vehicle, i turned it off in a drive thru line and less than 2 minutes later cranked it up and received the power steering assist failure error. my steering wheel had no power steering, it took everything i had to manage to drive the car into a parking space. i turned it off and back on and it worked again. after reading everyone's experiences i find it ridiculous ford doesn't have a recall on the 2010 too!  this car is a financial drain and ford has definitely lost any future business from me! this happened only a few months after ford replaced the takata airbag which i've seen others complain about."
"on random occasions, while in motion at any speed, the message ""blind spot assist is inoperative"" and indicator lights stop working.  the only way to clear it is to stop the vehicle, turn off the ignition and start the vehicle back up."

"my steering started shaking. a few days later my power steering assist fault light came one. the following day my power steering went out. this problem was supposedly ""fixed"" on my vechical in 2017 due to a recall. however, according to paperwork it was recalibrated and not replaced and now is broken. do i have to pay for the repairs?"
"dear sirs, my vehicle suddenly showed ""power steering assist fault"" while i driving on the street. and steering column locked. i immediately slow down and pullover the roadside. after this, steering column can be turned, but very hard and only within a narrow angle. therefore i go online to check, and found out my ford fusion 2011 should be under ""nhtsa safety recall no. 15v340000 - loss of electric power steering assist.(power steering control module (pscm) failed)""  please check my vin [xxx], it should be under ""ford's recall list"".  thanks for your help and hope can get your reply soon!    information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6).  *tr"
my vehicle has lost the use of power steering while in motion. the vehicle becomes very hard to steer manually and must be pulled over and restarted to attempt to bring the power steering back online. it has happened a couple of times on city streets and highways. restarting the car does not always bring the power steering back online. it is extremely dangerous to lose power steering while driving down the road. the dash warning 'power steering assist fault' appears during the event that the power steering malfunctions.
"this is a 2014 ford fusion titanium. 42,*** miles on the car. my car is a certified preowed car. i just started my car in the morning and 3 different warnings came on. the car wasn't moving when this happened. car was parked in my driveway. driven the night before no problems. i haven't hit anything or any other service performed since last oil change.    lights that came on steering assist fault service required, hill start assist not available and service advancetrac. these are the light and warnings that came on.    this makes it to where the car had no power steering and very hard to move the wheel. i had to drive it to the dealership and they're currently looking at it for the cause.    i do have a video of the warning lights coming on."
while driving on a residential street my car jolted to a stop by itself. there were no cars in front of me and no reason for the automatic emergency braking system to take control. after my car came to a stop it wouldn't move for a few seconds.

"last week the steering wheel would shake when at a stop. yesterday we got an error code saying ""power steering assist fault"". then the power steering went out when driving on the highway. we learned that there was a recall for this exact failure for our year/make/model of car for the ford plant where ours was built (kansas city) but our vin number is not part of the recall. i contacted the dealership and they said there is nothing they can do for us but to charge us full price for the repair."
went to the gas station everything was fine. i go to leave and i have no power steering. i had to drive through our city to get on the highway to get home. it was extremely hard to steer all the way home especially the slower i went. when i got home i see on the internet that they have a problem with the power steering assist module. but there is not a recall for this yet. this happened with only 72000.

i started to have a issue with the power steering assist a few days ago. the car had a weird noise on the steering and the steering wheel will shake on its own when the vehicle was on. it was not until yesterday that the power steering locked up as i was driving. steering became heavy. it was very dificult to perform sharp turns. there was a message  and a chime upon the steering getting stiff. i took my vehicle to the dealership and was told that although there is a recall notice for my particular vehicle that when using the vin code no recalls come up so that they would not perform the service.
"ford reprogrammed computer, was supposed to fix the problem. driving vehicle and power steering assist failure occurred."

i was driving down the road and went to make a turn and in mid turn and without warning the power steering assist fault message popped up on my dash and my steering wheel locked up and i nearly died due to a head on collision as i was trying to turn into my subdivision and it locked up while i was in the on coming traffic lane trying to cross over. very scary just locked up without any warning.  i've had zero issues whatsoever with it. no problems at all in the 9 years i've had this car besides the other recalls on it. cant stress enough how scary it was to just be driving and without warning nearly being killed by a car malfunction.
"cruise control will shut off when using turning signal or rolling up windows. it is very dangerous in busy interstate traffic. service stabli track and steering assist reduced will come up on display. power steering is intermittent when turning. headlights flicker when turning signals are used. truck will completely shut down for a split second while driving then everything comes back on, complete loss of control when this happens. when knob for headlights is turned from auto to on position the dash and instrument panel gets dim and stabli track and reduced steering assist message comes on. rear passenger door will not lock using fob, sometimes i will have to hit the unlock button multiple times before door will unlock after lock has been manually pushed down. passenger seat belt ding is also intermittent, sometimes it will not work at all. my truck just now started having all of these issues at the exact same time. we drove from texas to kentucky and back to texas and these issues all started during this trip. it is not safe for my family, i have always bought chevrolet and currently own this truck and a tahoe but they may be my last. all bulbs are good, all fuses and relays are good. truck now has 66000 miles on it. battery was replaced around 59000 miles. seems to be a wiring or ecm (computer) issue to me. i see many complaints similar to mine but yet no recalls have been issued for my vin number."

in march 2018 i went to get in my car and a warning came across my dash board that said power steering assist fault and then my steering would not move.  i got it fixed then. now almost a year later it's having the same issue but this time it locked up where as last time all i had to do is restart the car and it released.
electronic power steering causing unsafe instability on freeways. intermittently the power steering assist is failing intermittently causing the driver to apply excessive force to move the steering wheel but soon after this the power steering assist comes back on and hence turning the steering more than required and ending up in an unsafe position or swerving on freeways and even at low speeds. the issue seems to be a well documented issue and can happen at any mileage with reports out there on cars with less than 5k miles. audi should have a tsb and recall for this.
"i started my car and a warning light came on saying power steering assist was out.  the car was very hard to steer.  the next time i started car, the problem was gone.  however, since then, the problem has returned and it is unsafe to this car drive in traffic.  my research shows this is a commonand  dangerous situation and needs to be corrected by ford on the 2012"
"i purchased a new 2018 honda accord hybrid on june 30, 2018 from honda of kirkland for my daughter.  on monday, february 25, 2019, when she was driving back from class on a road at 35 mph, the collision mitigation system brake warning flashed then braked immediately, stopping the car in traffic.  no obstacles or cars were in front of her.   fortunately, the cars behind her were far enough away that they were able to stop.  in addition, she tried to get out of the way of traffic by pressing the accelerator, but the car would not respond for several moments after the automatic braking occurred.  she also told me that the brake warning had been coming on often when nothing was in front of her.    in addition, the lane departure feature has been malfunctioning, trying to pull her to the left lane into oncoming traffic when driving on curving roads.  the car is currently at the honda dealership, but the only thing they found was ""a little dirt"" on one of the sensors, stating that there was nothing wrong with the honda sensing system.    i have found class action lawsuits filed against honda for faulty collision mitigation  systems on at least two of their models (accord & crv).  in addition, i have found pages of results for these problems with honda and acura (honda corporation) when simply typing in ""collision mitigation system problems"".  please see the links below. *dt  consumer requested to add the following link  https://www.classlawgroup.com/honda-accord-collision-mitigation-sytem-class-action-lawsuit/  *jb"

while traveling at 35mph on a city street an alert sounded on the vehicle followed by a message stating power steering assist fault. vehicle immediately became hard to steer and nearly resulted in a collusion. managed to pull vehicle in a parking lot and message continued to be displayed after restarting vehicle. contacted tow service to have vehicle towed to dealership.
power steering assist and traction control light came on while driving and lost power steering causing major unsafe condition. was able to drive vehicle but with great amount of difficulty turning the steering wheel. took vehicle a shop where they got a code of u3000-96 there is a recall for 2011 mercury milan's 15v340000 it covers vehicles made 9/2010-2/2012 my milan was built 3/2010 yet not included in this recall even though many other owners have claimed the specific power steering assist feature failed in their cars as well. what is ones recourse as there is clearly a major safety problem with this component: thank you
"engine shuts off, steering assist disappears and steering wheel is jerked out of my hand, stabilitrak warnings on dash, hvac screen goes blank, chimes start going off. this occurred as i was pulling into a parking lot and i almost hit another car. the vehicle was moving at no more than 10mph."
"while driving my explorer down a city street at approx 45mph, the steering became extremely tight. a warning light saying 'steering assist fault' came in and then the 'traction control off' light came on. immediately after both of those lights came on a red light came on saying 'steering failure service required' came on and i completely lost the ability to steer the suv. i managed to get it off the road safely and stopped. the steering wheel would not turn at all. i contacted the ford dealership near me and told them what happened. they said there is a recall on 2011-2013 and 2015-2017 ford explorers but not the 2014 and what i was describing is what happens to the other models years under recall. there needs to be a recall on the 2014 explorers for the steering gear assembly as with the surrounding model years. had i been a less experienced driver this would have caused a crash and could have injured or killed myself or other people on the road. the failure of this system is dangerous to not only the driver but to other people on the road."
"during very cold conditions (below 10 degrees fahrenheit), the vehicle's steering feels loose, numb and disconnected.  at first i thought it was an issue with the driver assistance systems/lane keep assist.  i turned all those systems off and the issue persisted.  when conditions became warmer, the issue went away.  it has only occurred in extreme cold.  my bmw dealer advised that they were aware of the issue and that the service manager's vehicle is doing a same thing.  they indicated that bmw advises a software update is forthcoming, but when?  we have had a number of issues with this vehicle since delivery in november. all software related, and none have been corrected by updates yet.  the rest of them are annoyances, unacceptable yes, but this steering issue is a safety issue.  it is concerning that it exists in the first place and shocking that weeks later, it still has not been addressed.  other owners are reporting the same issue in owners' forums."
while dropping off my children at school the car came to a complete stop and went into auto stop. when releasing the peddle so the car could turn back on the whole dash board and the radio screen completely cut off and when the car turned off it all switched back on. the dash screen flagged and said steering assistant is reduced drive with care. this repeatedly happended another two times everytime i came to a complete stop. after the third time the car did not turn off at all.  in the past i have had the error message come on when the car would come to a stop and the car would turn back on but i am beginning to become very worried because now the whole dash board and radio are turning off. i was on a regular city street but am worried when i return to work after my vacation i will get stranded. i am attaching screenshots of a video i was able to capture on the third time this happened to me. the time is attached also.
issue with the lane assist feature. seems like it is to sensitive. on 3/3/19 i was driving on the highway going about 65 mph on a slight curved road and the with clear markings. the system seems to have picked up on some tire marks and swerved towards the center medium which easily could have caused an accident. i managed to regain control and turned the lane assist off.
"power assist recall/air bag recall  the electrical power steering in my car has created a problem when driving on the interstate. the cost to repair the car is in excess of $1200 new and $600 or more used. the electrical panel in the car is not completely functional either. i have problems with power windows and locks. there have been a total of more than 10 recalls on this particular model vehicle. i cannot afford to repair or purchase another vehicle. when i investigated further this was the latest issue listed. steering:electric power assist system recall  summary: hyundai motor company (hyundai) is recalling certain model year 2011 sonata vehicles manufactured december 11, 2009, to october 31, 2010. in the affected vehicles, the electronic power steering (eps) circuit board may be damaged and result in a loss of power steering assist.  in addition there are several air bag recalls on the vehicle. including the following: frontal air bags, seat belt pretensioners, and side air bags are disabled, there is an increased risk of injury to the vehicle occupants in the event of a vehicle crash that necessitates deployment of these safety systems.

"for the last couple months, i will occasionally start the car and find i am briefly without power steering. the power steering usually kicks in after a few moments of waiting while parked. however, today, 3.7.2019, i started the car, i found there was no power steering, and then i received a message on my console that read, ""power steering assist fault,"" or something similar. i turned off the car, restated, and the power steering did engage. however, now i am uncertain if i can rely on my power steering and will be getting it fixed soon."

"while driving, safety systems go offline. adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, road departure mitigation, collision mitigation braking system, and others all go offline at the same time. appears to happen at random. first visit to dealer, we were advised they did not see any codes and there was no malfunction at that time.  next visit, all the systems were still offline from earlier in the day and they performed some software updates which reset everything. next day, safety systems went offline again.  we took the vehicle back to the dealer where it is right now and they are advising that it is a fuel issue and gasoline is getting into the oil .  no explanation how or why this is causing the safety systems to go offline and become inoperable.  have contacted honda multiple times along they way, currently waiting on a case manager to call back."
"i was driving to honda dealer on march 6, 2019 for my second oil change as a result of me calling the dealership and telling them my oil smelled like it had gas in it again.  this is with less than 700 miles since the first oil change that i had done on february 13, 2019.  my first oil change was with 4525 miles, this was done as part of a recall on my vehicle.  on this march 6th trip i was about 40 miles away from the dealership and my acc (adaptive cruise control)  shut down, the collision mitigation system problem and  road departure mitigation system problem lights all came up on dash of car and kept scrolling on dash.   when my car did this i was unsure, felt unsafe and was frustrated as not knowing  what was going on and how many more problems i am going to have with this vehicle.  i found a safe place to pull over and called the dealer and told him what was going on, he said the car was safe to drive but those systems that were scrolling on dash weren't operating.  it was 6 f outside  a clear road and a sunny day in north dakota.  after the oil change, i was told the oil was high and that there was again gas in my oil again.    at this point i am beyond frustrated and wondering how many more problems i will be having with this new vehicle and the nearest dealership to me is 100 miles away, which causes me time and expense to get to dealership. this also causes me to wonder how reliable this new  vehicle can be in north dakota in the winter time as also not getting much heat out of the heating system either, so between the heat, the gas in the oil  and electrical problems i am not feeling that this is a safe dependable vehicle to drive, as a person could freeze to death if ended up stranded when the car shuts down and no heat,  like it did when i had my appointment for the recall on 2-12-19 and it had to be put on flat bed truck to get recall done."
"on march 7th, 2019 at 0600 hours, an error code popped up on the dash showing a power steering assist fault.  car was stationary at this time at homeowners driveway.  steering wheel was difficult to turn as there was no power to the steering.  according to to nhtsa documentation, numerous complaints on this same related issue prompted recalls on other models, however 2010 ford fusion, which experienced same problem was omitted from original recall.  further research revealed numerous complaints regarding same or similar issue prompting another investigation.  unknown what the second results yielded."

"automatic emergency braking system on my vehicle initiates when not needed intermittently.  no vehicles, objects, items, curbs, etc in vicinity or in front of vehicle.  took vehicle to dealership for voluntary aeb update, per notice from nissan, and due to it not being 'active' code, update could not be performed.    was explained to me that code could be seen as having 'popped', but due to car having been turned off and then turned on prior to being at dealership for inspection, their maintenance processes prevent the software update.  it was further explained to me that once i turn car off after the aeb event, that it is no longer an active code, but becomes a passive code.    this becomes an issue due the very nature of requiring an active code, as i will assume that not all owners are able to go directly from the aeb activation straight to a nissan dealer (i myself have this issue as it has repeatedly happened to me in the mornings on my way to campus or work and am unable to take it to dealer without having the car turned off for some time.).   this should be elevated to a warranty recall regardless of active code or not, as having a software issue regarding a braking system should be considered more than just inconvenient."

"i called ford after the ""power steering assist fault"" light came on and the vehicle could not turn. it was parallel parked along side a street, and i was only able to put the car in drive and move forward and backward. the wheel was making loud, grunting noises and shaking profusely. i looked up and found that there had been a recall for mercury mariner 2008 models for the same issue. i called and spoke with oliver hogg, a service consultant at lindsay ford of wheaton and discussed that there was a recall and that it seemed to be exactly what was happening with my vehicle. he told me it would be covered by ford if that was the issue, if not, i would have to cover the cost and diagnostic. the diagnostic report stated, ""c/s steering is making noise and display reads steering assist fault--towed in. can for codes (b2278 steering shaft torque sensor fault (found steering hard and column motor chatter). replace steering column assembly (part #cl8z3c529d) (found steering hard and column motor chatter).  lindsay ford of wheaton quoted me $2,385.18 for the listed issues. he said my vin number wasn't covered under the recall, and there was not an extended warranty on the parts, so i was out of luck. i find this completely unacceptable, after learning of all of the other mercury mariners of 2008 to have the same issue, and even with the recall. this is unsafe, and a product of ford manufacturing, and should be resolved within ford motor company."

"i experienced several near misses related to two adas features as i rented this new rav4 in atlanta. firstly, the lane-centering feature actively tried to guide my vehicle out of its lane while driving on the highway. this typically occurred when driving across overpasses where the pavement type transitioned. the left and right lane markings were present on the pavement throughout these events. the steering wheel moved with force and speed--had my reaction time been half a second longer, i would have struck vehicles next to me. secondly, the vehicle's full-range adaptive cruise control braked abruptly, especially at lower speeds, on nearly every occasion where highway/city traffic slowed or stopped. i was nearly rear-ended due to the jerky actions of the system. the vehicles in front braked smoothly during these events--only my vehicle slammed on its brakes when it could have lightly applied them to slow down safely. it appears that toyota might have my data from 3/13/2019, since a sticker on the overhead console states: ""vehicle data transmission is on! your vehicle wirelessly transmits location, driving and vehicle health data to deliver your services and for internal research and data analysis..."" i hope that nhtsa can work with toyota to examine these records and improve these systems."
"i have a 2010 mercury mariner.  there was a recall for the power steering. i didn't get it taken in right away,  just took it in december 2018 for oil change and had dealership take care of recall also. they updated the software but that is when my trouble started with the power steering.  steering wheel had a twitch, shaking by itself while car was running at idle.  when the shaking got real bad i took it to dealer march 7 2019 to be fixed under recall for power steering assist loss. the recall started july 25 2014 with no end date of recall.  they told me that they couldn't fix it under the recall because ford said it had been to long after the recall. basically they were saying the recall was outdated. they told me i could have it fixed for $800 out of pocket.  a recall should never be outdated but go the life of the vehicle. every vehicle is different when the the part goes bad after a recall happens. mine was almost 5 years after recall started. it is a safety issue because your power steering goes out if not fixed after the steering wheel starts twitching.  my power steering went out 2 days after i had taken it in to the dealership to have it fixed for what i thought was a real recall.  apparently ford has fake recalls.  when you take your vehicle in they refuse to fix it because they say what recall.  the power steering went out when i stopped to get gas. i started the car back up after getting gas it was gone.  i called ford customer service number march 14 2019.  i let them know what my issue was.  they did there research and called me back march 15 2019 only to let me know that the update the dealership did in december 2018 was the fix.   it was one and done. they were not doing anything else, they told me.  so the update cancelled out the real fix of changing the torque sensor in the steering column which 2 days later left me without power steering.

"as i was driving through a busy freeway, my steering wheel just locked up making it very difficult for me to turn.  i struggled and managed to pull onto the shoulder. i turned the engine off and turned it on a few times but it did not change anything.  the fault message ""power steering assist fault"" and ""service advancetrac"" did not go away.  i drove the car to the closest mechanic shop.  the mechanic  mentioned to me that i have to replace the steering rack and pinion and perform a wheel alignment. he also mentioned that i may have to reprogram the power steering control module.  he gave me a fat estimate of $2100.  apparently this same issue has been recalled by ford on their 2011-13 models but not on 2010.  i was surprised to read that and reputed companies like ford does not take care of this issue for their valued (?) customers.  the car is not worth putting that kind of money in it.  i may just put that money as a down payment and get another car."
"two different incidents: (3/13/18) while driving, the power steering went out and the light came on ""steering assist fault - service required"". after that, pulled over and turned off the vehicle and waited a few minutes before turning back on. after restarting, the steering worked okay again. had this later checked by astoria ford, and they could not find anything wrong (even after running the codes). then on 3/15/19, got in the vehicle and started it and the light came on again. this time even after stopping and re-starting the engine (waiting @ 5-10 minutes) the light remained on and there was no steering. currently, the vehicle is at a astoria aamco getting checked thoroughly by a very competent, highly experienced mechanic to get this resolved for our safety."

"on more than one occasion, when driving in enhanced auto-pilot and engaged auto lane change, the car started changing lanes, then abruptly swerved back into my original lane.  i looked behind me and coast was clear. it's not at all apparent why the car aborts the lane change.  i was driving the speed limit, 65 mph on a 3 lane highway and i was in a middle lane, changing into the right lane. first occurance was in traffic with plenty of space between vehicles to  execute a safe lane change. once the vehicle returns to the original lane it will attempt and successfully change lanes. other occurances similiar in nature. when rounding a curve and executing a lane change with ehanced auto pilot on, the manuever is more abrupt, serious safety concern. all engaged functions of auto pilot disengaged due to erratic movement.  as mentioned, this is an ongoing problem and on other tesla blogs similiar occurances are reported.  a bulletin needs to be issued relating the problem and hazard to tesla owners and tesla needs to supply a fix to the problem"

"while driving approximately 45 mph in traffic on the 5 freeway in los angeles, a warning came up on the dashboard stating ""steering assist fault - service required"". after the message displayed, a turn in the road was coming up and i noted that i had no power steering and had to use excessive force to turn the wheel to make the turn. luckily i managed to nurse the car back home without causing an accident or going off the road. turning at slow speeds is nearly impossible. i will be taking the vehicle into the ford dealership but it is my understanding that similar issues have occured to multiple 2012 focus vehicles and no recall has been issued similar to other recalls for different ford models. luckily my current failure did not cause an accident, but the car is not a hazard to drive for both myself and other motorists. this issue needs a recall before someone gets injured or worse, and owners don't have to fork over $1500+ to fix the issue as seems common online."
"driving on a highway, 65 mph, with acc cruise control on.  suddenly it deactivated.  warning light for acc/ road departure mitigation/ collision mitigation and brake system problems warning indicators came on.  brake system warning was particularly stressful.  i tried brakes and they seemed normal but acc definitely did not work.  tried multiple times to turn off system and turn it back on to no avail.  windshield was clean as was front sensor area.  as i was on a highway i couldn't stop.  an hour latter, while still on the road warning lights went off and all systems were available. dealer was unable to determine what had happened.  now a month later same happened again and system recovered in about an hour while still driving.  lane keeping assist system was still working while the other systems went out so the camera was still functioning.  car seemed to function normally while these systems were out. as a former mechanic,police driving instructor and crash reconstructionist i know that this can not be caused by ""low gas"" or ""gas in the oil"".  this is an electronics problem. i have also had the tire monitoring system malfunction three times."
"tl* the contact owns a 2014 lincoln mks. the contact stated that the steering wheel seized. while driving at low speeds, the power steering assist indicator illuminated and prevented the contact from turning the steering wheel. the contact had to turn the steering wheel with force. the contact was able to drive the vehicle home. the vehicle was towed to ford lincoln long-lewis (2551 john hawkins parkway, birmingham, alabama, 35244, (205)-989-3673) where it was diagnosed that the power steering gear rack and pinion assembly failed. the manufacturer stated that the vehicle was not included in nhtsa campaign number: 15v340000 (steering). the vehicle was not repaired. the failure mileage was 50,000.

"when i start my vehicle i get a warning that says, ""power steering assist fault"" and i can not turn my steering wheel whatsoever. this is not the first time this has happened although this time the vehicle is not able to turn at all anymore. the first time this happened i was turning into a parking spot and the wheels locked up and after 3-5 attempts of starting and stopping the engine the issue was resolved. the second time this happened i was parked in my driveway and when i started my vehicle to leave, as i proceeded to back out of my driveway the wheels wouldn't turn and my vehicle went straight backwards. after letting the vehicle sit for several hours the issue was self resolved. the third time this happened which was the most recent i started the vehicle and got the warning again and checked the wheels and they would not turn at all. the vehicle is now stuck in my driveway and will only go forwards and backwards as the wheels do not turn at all. nothing seems to be resolving the issue now. not every time it happens do i get the warning on the dash first, only after it happens do i get a notification on the dash.  i am just glad this did not happen when i was driving down the road with my family in the car."
"the power steering assist has gone out.  ford did a recall on this part but if you weren't having any problems with it at the time they did the recall they would just flash your ecu and call it good.  this doesn't actually prevent the failure from happening.  so eventually the power steering fails like it did to me while i was driving on the freeway, which is a known problem.  they then want to charge you to have the steering angle torque sensor replaced.  this is a safety issue and should be replaced by ford at their expense."
"i have replaced the alternator, the electric power steering assist motor and air filter on multiple occasions and, after doing some research, have found that my car is experiencing every issue th's to have seen in previous gm vehicle safety recalls. unfortunately, my vin number seems to be one of those that has not been identified has having had those issues although it currently is experiencing them. i want to lodge a complaint that the vin number search tool is not accurate enough to determine the validity of a claim. i say this because even on the nhtsa website, the tool says that not all vin numbers that are experiencing issues with a recall have actually been associated to any recalls. as there do exist current recalls for all 07 pontiac g6 models, there are no recalls related to my specific vin number. but, all of the recalls directly mention every issues that my car is currently experiencing. including, the transmission not properly shifting due to a madness or break in the shift cable, the power steering motor suddenly dying, the car experiencing a sudden loss of power, etc. each of these issues is directly mentioned in a recall for g6 models in general, but for some reason, not for my car, specifically?"
"driving at 50mph, total loss of power steering nearly causing a major accidebt, electric steering assist light on. same problem as 2014 recall but according to ford apparently this vin isn't covered. pathetic response to a major safety issue."

"electronic steering assist gives out while driving at all speeds, but especially at slower speeds 5-35mph. the steering wheel almost feels like it grabs and you have to pull the wheel back to stay in your lane and avoid a collision. very dangerous, as this seemed to have come on very suddenly."

have taken my brand new 2019 honda accord sport 1.5 to two different dealerships due to my car not tracking straight. each time a minor tweak was done to the alignment. after researching a bit more i found there is an issue with the gear box being faulty (53620-twa-a28) which causes the tracking to be off with and without lane keep assist engaged. i am trying to get this issue rectified and awaiting dealer feedback. i have contacted the dealer and made them aware of the issue.  the 2018 and 2019 accords are very similar and the issue is present in 2018s and a few 2019s after reading accounts on 'accordxclub.com'. my build month and year was november 2018.

"gm recalled several vehicles for problems with the power steering and electric steering assist in 2014. according to the gm newsbrief, ""if power steering assist is lost, a message displays on the driver information center and a chime sound to inform the driver. steering control can be maintained because the vehicle will revert to manual steering, but greater driver effort would be required at low vehicle speeds, which could increase the risk of a crash.""    chipman & taylor, a certified gm dealer and service repair shop, has indicated that the aforementioned units are failing in my vehicle which was identified as one of the vehicles in the recall. however, they indicated that the 2005 chevy malibu maxx ls was not eligible for the full repair and only replaced a singular part which did not fix the issue that they were attempting to resolve via their recall procedure.    it is both irresponsible and reprehensible that they are aware of the issue, made a statement regarding their intent to remedy the situation, and simultaneously failed to follow through with their promises to consumers. this type of negligence puts every person on the road at risk.    'with these safety recalls and lifetime warranties, we are going after every car that might have this problem, and we are going to make it right. we have recalled some of these vehicles before for the same issue and offered extended warranties on others, but we did not do enough.'    their failure to follow through with their promise is an atrocity of monumental proportions and should not be taken lightly. 612,203 vehicles were affected by this recall and gm has the audacity to allow citizens to be placed in grave danger due to their negligence."
"power steering assist fault message came up on dashboard while pulling into parking space.  loss of power steering.  vehicle undriveable.  after further investigation it appears despite a recall #14s05 being done by first owner in october 2014 same issue has again happened.  thankful this happened in a parking lot, not while going 65 mph on a highway.  this is used by our 20 year old daughter who is still a fairly new driver.  when we called ford they told us secondary repair is on us since recall was already preformed.  extremely disappointing that safety is not their first priority; secondly that they do not stand behind fixing what clearly seems to be a manufacturers defect that could lead to a very different outcome.  mileage tbd.  unable to read dash with error message."

""issue was my driver front tire... it's the wire harness that goes back to the cpu from the abs speed sensor. this should be a recall in my opinion as a lot of people are having this issue which causes electrical power steering assist to turn off making it harder to turn the steering wheel"" quoted from the youtube video.    where the wires connect or something along that line. it would be really appreciated if ford looked into this and made a recall. this is not safe considering it disables some (or all) of your steering capabilities.    more detail: all lights have lit up before during the first snow-fall (but shortly after turned off). i purchased the car with 70,000 miles on it, in july of 18'. it is now march of 19' and we've had warm days up until today, when we had snow again here in central new york. now the problem arises again.    please recall this issue."

"my subaru starlink infotainment system has experienced 5 events of total blackout to the infotainment screen over the 9-month period since purchasing. this has resulted in loss of functionality to the phone, bluetooth, radio and backup camera capabilities. safety was the number one reason why i chose this car (backup camera, lane departure assist, adaptive cruise control). to know that roughly 30% of all minor vehicle accidents occur due to backup-related issues, it scares me that my car is not protecting me from this potential risk. not only is this a risk to basic safety principles, but it also makes my everyday travel chaotic and stressful. i drive for up to 2-3 hours at a time, and to have zero access to basic fm radio, siriusxm radio, bluetooth-connected podcasts / e-books makes focusing difficult. additionally, with no bluetooth phone connection available, i am forced to hold my phone while driving, taking one of my hands off the wheel, and distracting me from focusing on driving. it's absurd to me that this issue has been raised by hundreds of subaru owners across multiple model vehicles, and it has not been addressed. if, god forbid, something was to happen to me or my wife while driving this car due to an issue that subaru knew about, i don't know what i would do. to make matters worse, i was just informed after 2 hours in the service waiting area that the subaru-issued software update will not fix the issue, and i have to come back in 2-3 weeks after the dealership receives a completely new radio display board system for install. when there is something safety-related at hand, and the company in question makes no escalated effort to expedite the solution, it heightens my concern with the company's commitment to safety. this situation is frustrating, yes; but more than anything, it questions whether or not i am best protected within the confines of a subaru."

"i wanted to express my concerns relating to tesla's treatment of owners who have a salvaged car.     tesla actively blacklist cars with salvaged titles and makes it next to impossible to purchase replacement parts. leaving owners with no option but to buy parts second hand or otherwise pay tesla a fee to have the car re-certified after the repairs have been completed.     with tesla's direct control of their service centers, lack of dealers or independent shops. this means that the only way to get parts or service is through tesla themselves. yet in the past they have refused to work on salvaged cars until they have been recertifed by tesla. this could potentially lead to hundreds of thousands of car on the road that need access to parts, service and repairs. that due to tesla's policies could potentially become a liability on the road.     the second area of concern is that tesla also can send updates that actively deactivate features of the car. such as autopilot and access to the supercharging network. even if said features where purchased and are thus linked to the car for it's foreseeable lifetime. this is a testament to the technology and capabilities of over the air updates.     however, by disabling software updates. it could lead to salvaged cars having grossly outdated software. potentially leading to hundreds of thousands of individuals operating cars with potentially buggy outdated software, that would have otherwise been patched and lead to a accident due to a shutdown event, ect. not to mention the act of disabling autopilot disables safety features such as automatic breaking, that could prevent a accident in the first place.     it is thus, my hope that nhtsa could look into these concerns and hopefully make all tesla cars safer in the road. tesla is the only automaker that currently has this policy and indeed the only automaker that has this capability"

"i was driving in the right lane on a  four lane interstate highway with good driving conditions and a 70 mph speed limit.  the car was an enterprise rental.    adaptive cruise control uses the accelerator and brakes to maintain a safe distance to the car ahead.  it is done by sensing the distance to the car ahead at about 5 car lengths then adjusting the accelerator and brakes as needed to maintain this spacing and avoid a rear end collision.    the fault is seen in changing lanes.    the cruise was set at 70 mph and my car approached a car ahead going 65 mph. my car's adaptive cruise decelerated to 65 mph.  i steered into the next lane, and the space was not the requisite 5 car lengths, the car sensed a car closer than 5 lengths reducing my speed to less than 65 mph.      my car was now slowing down below 65 mph in a lane with cars going 70 mph.  i pressed on the accelerator, accelerating to 70 mph, avoiding a rear end collision.    enterprise did not inform me of the adaptive cruise features and operation.  there was no warning sticker in the car stating:   ""turn off cruise control  when changing lanes."""
"on april 2, 2019 i parked brefily for about 30 minutes. upon re-entering my 2019 gmc sierra truck with approximately 4500 miles and starting the engine i immediately received multiple warning messages on my dash panel. they were ""service esc"" ""service trailer brake"", ""brake system failure"" ""steering assist reduced"" and to drive no faster than 62 mph.  previously prior to parking i had never had any problems whatsoever. i was in a location where i needed to go so i attempted to drive but found quickly that the brake pedel went all the way to the floor with very limited or basically no braking. the steering became very difficult with no apparent power assist. i drove it approximately two miles and got to a location where i could park. i turned the engine off and back on and the problem did not go away. i turned it off again and waited a couple of minutes and then heard an automated couple of clunk sounds from the front.. i started it up and everything was okay except the check engine light was on and stayed on the rest of evening. the next morning the check engine light was still on however about twenty minutes later i noticed it was off and everything has been fine since. i had planned to take it to the gmc dealer however with no problem showing now and from past experience with the dealerships i decided there was no need to schedule an appointment until the symptoms come back. i found on the internet later that there are numerous instances where this has happened to many other 2019 gmc sierra owners. i feel that this is a extremely serious problem that needs immediate attention especially with the near total braking system failure!"

"pulled into hotel parking lot at 11:05am (perfect weather - parking lot empty) and ,after turning into the parking spot at a slow speed, the car suddenly accelerated and hit the side of the hotel.  the building wasn't damaged, but the car had serious frontal damage.  the hotel manager didn't call the police so there isn't a police report.  the air bags did not go off.  i feel there were several possible lexus problems with this incident:  the air bags did not go off even though there was over $17,000 in repairs (even the engine had to be removed),; the automatic braking system didn't engage; and the sudden acceleration of the car from a slow entry into the parking space.  currently the car is at a lexus dealer waiting for the lexus hired inspector to examine it.  we have pictures and a complete list of repairs if requested.   w e  do not have a report yet from the lexus inspection because it hasn't been inspected yet. ...*bf..*jb"

"i have had an issue with the adaptive cruise control multiple (10-12) times.     the cr-v seems to ""lose"" the car in front causing it to accelerate (if the person in front of you is going slower than your cruise is set for). then when it ""finds"" the car again and it brakes suddenly.    i took the car into the dealer about a week and a half ago complaining. they could not reproduce the issue and sent me along with no fix.  "
"with the 2019 model of cr-v, i am unable to only turn of the lane keep assist. there is no mention in the owner's manual about how to exclusively turn the lane keep assist off, or at the very least configure it so that it does not apply force on the steering wheel. all other advanced features can either not be turned on, or deselected in the menu. this is a problem because the lane keep assist is incorrectly applying steering wheel forces. there is a lot of road construction by me and the system will try and pull the car into the vehicle traveling in the next lane. a huge problem if it is a semi truck.  there must be a way to defeat this feature and not effect other safety  features that do function correctly."
"power steering failure message lit up on dash while traveling down the road at approx 40 mph. power steering seemed fine. after parking the car and leaving it several hours, started the car and message came back and car had no power steering assist. i was lucky that i was not traveling down he road when failure occurred."

"i was driving on 2-lane road and the right side detection system (sds) indicator light in the side mirror came on even when there were no cars or objects next to me. the indicator light would not turn off even when the car was off and parked. no warning messages came up when the car was started.  i turned the sds and park assist off in settings, but the light remained on. i removed fuse 62 (rear camera/park assist/side blind zone alert) in the engine compartment fuse block to get the light off. i reinstalled the fuse and the light remained off until the next time i started the car and it turned back on and stayed on.  a few days later i got a warning message to service the sds when i started my car. the blind zone alert system indicator lights did not come on and the system did not work at all even when vehicles were in my blind spot on the left or right side of my car.  i received 3 warning messages when i started my car. they said to service front camera, park assist and sds. fuse 62 was blown. i replaced the fuse and it immediately blew again. none of the driver assist systems worked including the side blind zone alert, lane departure warning, forward collision alert system, park assist and rear cross-traffic alert.  i took my car to lake geneva chevrolet dealership. they diagnosed the problem, which required removing the rear bumper to check the 2 sbza modules mounted on the inside corners of the bumper. they discovered corrosion in both modules due to water intrusion, which shorted out the electronics. they said it was caused by water on the module seam getting into it by freeze thaw. they had to replace both modules for a total cost including labor of $1172. they stated that it will happen again since it is the same module design and due to the mounting location. chevy has know about this since before 5-2017 when they issued tsb# 17-na-154 about exact problem."
"after starting the car, i get message ""power steering assist fault"". after moving just a few feet, the traction light comes on and i get message ""service advancetrac"". the dealership tells me the electric rack needs to be replaced and the part alone is over $1600. from my understanding, the 2011 and 2012 models have been recalled, and the 2010 models have the same part number for the recalled rack."
"the incident occurred on or about thursday, april 10th 2019 at 12:10am. it involves the brakes of the vehicle not being able to stop the vehicle at low speeds. the entire incident was captured on a high-quality front-facing dashboard camera with audio, video, and gps. there were no injuries.    description of the incident is as follows:    while i was on the interstate 10 west freeway in redlands, ca, i maneuvered to the most right lane on the highway in preparation to approach an exit less than 1 mile away (university ave.)     due to lane closures (left lanes) at the time i was on the freeway, traffic was bumper-to-bumper and very low speed. while in the most right lane and still at very low speed, i engaged the adaptive cruise control feature on the vehicle. within around 5 seconds of engaging the adaptive cruise control, the vehicle slowed down to a stop because of the vehicle in front of mine had stopped.     at that point, the cruise control feature self-disengaged as normal. only a few seconds later, the vehicle possibly abnormally vibrated. as the vehicle continued to creep forward in traffic as normal, i applied the brakes to stop, but the vehicle would not stop or slow down. as i nearly approached colliding with the vehicle ahead of me, i engaged the parking/emergency brake with my foot, and that did not seem to slow or stop the vehicle either. a second attempt to engage the parking brake did nothing as well.    within a few seconds, the car almost slowed to a stop due to rolling friction and a slight uphill grade in that portion of the freeway. i placed the vehicle in park at this time and restarted the car. after restarting, i was able to drive and brake properly the rest of my short journey home.    this entire episode is captured on my dashboard camera, and it seems others on the internet have complained about this issue as well."
"while driving the power steering has went out several times.  at the time the dashboard indicator would say ""power steering assist fault"" and shortly after that say ""service advancetrac"".  upon research i have noticed there has a been a recall for the 2011-2015 mercury milan models but not the 2010.  i have found a ton of others with my vehicle experiencing this problem with the mileage ranging from low to high.  this is a very unsafe situation to experience with your family in the vehicle and have this happen.  this needs to be added to the other model milians recalls."

"passat brakes started squealing at around 9000 miles.  when serviced at dealer they stated brakes were fine.  squealing continued to 20k miles.  again serviced at dealer and said brakes were fine.  squeeling eventually stoped but after noticing severe vibration in steering wheel during freeway driving and when applying brakes, i stopped and took to nearby mechanic to inspect.  he reported rotors are warped at 26k miles.  this should not happen with a new car with light use.  since 3 years just passed car just exited warranty status.  this problem might be due to the adaptive cruise control feature as it tends to apply the brakes hard during normal driving if set to setting number 1.  to avoid hard braking, i have to keep the adaptive cruise at setting 3 which is what i've been doing when i do use it.  still, this seems to be a recurring issue in passats as apparent on search boards online.  vw should upgrade their adaptive cruise control firmware and replace impacted owners brakes, rotors and calipers.  brakes should not start going out a 9k miles and have warped rotors at 26k miles.  the dealer should have caught this problem while i was still under warranty instead of reporting no issues and passing inspection reports falsely.  make people safe, recall this safety issue immediately."

"i am submitting this ticket to document a hazardous scenario that i have experienced two times since purchasing my brand new 2019 acura rdx. incidents occurred while driving in ohio and pennsylvania on cool days (ambient temperatures between 30 and 50 deg fahrenheit), with and without rainfall. the following conditions were true for both occurrences. while driving on an interstate highway with adaptive cruise control [with low speed follow] and lane-keeping systems enabled, i decide to overtake a slower vehicle ahead of me. i depress the accelerator pedal without disabling the cruise control functions and change lanes to the faster lane. just as i execute this maneuver, the engine simultaneously goes into limp mode -- the maximum power output decreases dramatically and the malfunction indication lamp (cel) is blinking. at this point i have to get across all lanes of the highway to pull onto the shoulder, and i have to do this while the vehicle is slowing down. referencing my owner's guide, i see that the blinking cel indicates a misfire in the engine's cylinders is detected, and as instructed i turn off the engine in a ""safe"" place and wait for the engine to cool down. when i restart the engine, the cel is cleared and the vehicle resumes normal function.  i took my vehicle in for its first service appointment yesterday. i provided this anecdote to my service advisor, and asked that we check error code logs and inspect component systems for damage. i was informed that there were no error codes logged, and that there should be such a log if, in fact, the cel was indicating. all component systems passed inspection/diagnosis.  i am attaching a pdf containing the full description text of the ticket submission that i have made to acura client services."

"after less than four years of ownership, and outside of the 3 year/36,000 mile warranty, the adaptive cruise control module(s) failed for no apparent reason, rendering the entire cruise control system inactive. the nature of the safety systems in volkswagens is such that if one system is not working, none will - thus, the 'front assist' collision avoidance system is no longer active, which is an integral part of the active safety technology in the touareg. in addition, basic speed modulation of conventional cruise control is also unavailable. the reliability of basic systems such as cruise control should not be contingent upon immensely expensive, and overly complicated technological components."

(very dangerous.) both times, when i shutdown and immediately restarted the car, it then ran normally. however, both times after this happened, the car's idle start/stop function stopped working (the engine never shut off at stops). so far, i have not been able to purposely recreate the problem when i try to do so in safe driving conditions. the first time i took it to the dealership, they didn't find any code or anything wrong with it. however, whatever they did caused the idle start/stop function to start working again. this time it has been 6 days and the idle start/stop function hasn't activated once (i have not returned to dealer yet). acura client relations claims they will have a field technician test my car, but i may have to wait weeks or months for that to happen. other owners are reporting near identical problems on https://www.carcomplaints.com/acura/rdx/2019/engine/engine.shtml this is going to result in a car crash at some point for some driver, so urgent attention is needed to resolve the problem."

"in order to cancel cruise control or autopilot in a tesla model 3, the primary mechanism is to push the right stalk upwards as far as it will go. however, pushing the same stalk upwards only part of the way will cause the car to shift into neutral. this can cause a driver to put the car into neutral while it is underway. this is especially dangerous in a tesla because if the car is in neutral regenerative breaking is disabled and it is the common driving habit to use regenerative breaking as the primary braking mechanism.    essentially, a driver can accidentally make the car unable to accelerate and unable to use primary braking when in motion.    in addition, there is no audible alert that the car has been shifted to neutral and only a very small visible change to the touchscreen.    i alerted tesla to this issue in august of 2018 and there has been no change to the car's behavior since then, despite numerous over the air software updates."

i won't to know why it's not mandatory for all newly manufactured vehicles to have the  computerized blind spot assistance (bsa)  system installed? this system must  be mandatory the same as seatbelts and airbags.  vehicles such as the nissans  have advanced warning systems for blind spots. countless  motor vehicles accidents happen daily because drivers can't properly see existing traffic  prior to changing lanes due to side mirror blind spots.  the dual/double side mirror must be made available so the dealers or the individual can remove/replace all existing mirrors.   it needs to be mandatory for current owners of all vehicles being driven to have at least the dual/split mirror. this safety requirement will save countless lives each day.  these warning systems should not be a luxury for only the rich. every life matters.  the technology is there and must be used to help save lives. please pass this on to whom ever can make a difference for change.

"purchased in 2016. in 2018 with about 80k on the odometer i began to experience intermittent eps failure. the first time i was driving on the highway and felt the steering get heavier. i pulled over and turned the car off. checked for damage under the hood and saw nothing. restarting the car, the issue went away. it occurred the next day and was intermittent for about two weeks, but now seems to be in failure 100% of the time.    when the failure occurs the eps warning light comes on and the steering becomes very heavy, as if there is zero power assistance from the eps system. the steering is still functional, so the issue does not seem to be mechanical with a 100% steering failure, it's only the powered steering assistance that is failing.     car is still operable but very cumbersome while parking, however my wife cannot drive the car safely because the steering is too heavy for her.    this failure has been reported in the 2013 accord as pe14033. the accord is the sister car to the crosstour (a previous model of crosstour was called the accord crosstour), so it seems likely they share the same cause and in my opinion the crosstour should be covered by the same tsb 15-055 issued by honda for 2013/2014 accords."

cranked up explorer and received power steering assist fault about a year and a half ago.  called dealership to check on recall or see what this was about.  we were told that there was no recall and by turning the explorer off and on again usually fixes the problem this did at that time.  then it happened again a couple months later and did what they said because they told us it was not communicating correctly.  it has not happened again for a while until today when trying to do that five times it did not communicate but this time it gave the same power steering assist fault and a service advancetrac message.  lucky this happened in a parking lot and my wife and kids were not in the car.  had to haul the vehicle out of parking lot to my house for the time being until i can get an answer on what needs to be done.  i did see that there was a recall on this same issue a while back after doing some research. lucky for me and my family every time these issues have popped up the car has been stationary.

"ford 2012 fusion sel power steering control module failure:  after receiving ford recall notice 15s18 regarding the power steering control module, i returned my car to the local ford dealership on 08/06/15 to have the recall complied with.  after completion of the recall, the service receipt noted no replacement parts were installed, only a ""reprogram of the power steering control module"".      now in june 2019, the car has displayed a ""power steering assist"" fault on the instrument cluster 4 times within the last 6 days.  the fault code did extinguish after turning the ignition to ""off"" and restarting the car.  this happened twice when the car was cold after sitting and backing up from a parking space, once after the car was driven, but after startup and engaging ""drive"", and again hot when backing out of a parking spot.     today i drove the subject car to the local dealership and discussed my options for repair with the ford service manager.  he explained that the probability of the power steering control module was pretty high and the faults would continually get worse (more often?) with time.  he explained that once the recall was complied with, ford considers the recall closed and any repairs/ faults after the recall at that time were the responsibility of the customer at the estimated cost of $2,220.  the service manager offered a diagnostic check for $119.  i decided not to have the diagnostic service performed believing that the service manager's opinion of the faulty power steering control module and my experience were enough to conclude a faulty power steering control module.    it seems that the faulty module, especially because it was never replaced at the time the recall was complied with, should be the full responsibility of ford.  the part is bad!  it just didn't test bad at the earlier date.  it still proved bad/ faulty."

"my car has a front emergency braking system. the sensor for this system is located at the front of the car, underneath one of the head lights. the sensor detects when a vehicle in front of you has stopped. as you get closer to the vehicle, if you do not stop, the car will sound a 3-beep alert notifying you to stop. if you still do not stop, the car will apply the brakes and force the car to stop to prevent an accident.     one night, i was driving home on a city street, when the 3-beep alert sounded, and the dashboard display started flashing red and white lights. there was a message on the display stating that a crash was imminent. then the brakes engaged suddenly, and the car almost came to a complete stop in the middle of the street. the brakes engaged so hard and so quickly, that it threw me forward in the seat. at the time, there was no car in front of me coming to a sudden stop and no crash was imminent. the closest car to me was 2-3 car lengths ahead, and it had not stopped. thankfully, the street was not busy at the time, and there was no accident.     nissan is aware of this issue, and there are class action lawsuits, but nissan won't issue a recall. i've taken my car to 2 nissan dealerships and they won't replace the sensor. the first dealer told me my sensor was dirty, but that doesn't explain what happened. according to the owner's manual, if the sensor is dirty, there will be a message on the dashboard display indicating the sensor is obstructed, and the front braking system will turn off.  that is not what happened to me. the second nissan dealer did a software update on my car and reset the sensor. i keep being told to bring the car back if the issue happens again, but this is not the kind of issue you want to wait to have happen again. what if i am on a busy street or the highway? i could have a serious accident. please investigate this."

"on two occasions, my car's automatic braking system has engaged when nothing was in front of me. the first time, i was on the highway, and merging from an on ramp. the car suddenly dead stopped, brakes fully engaged. there was a car next to me, but nothing in front of me to cause the braking system. luckily, no one was behind me. the second occurrence i was traveling about 30 mph on a local road. there was nothing anywhere around me. i approached a green light, and as i was going through the intersection, the cars braking system fully engaged. it screeched the car to a halt.  i was at a dead stop, in the middle of the intersection."
"in early 2018 the emergency braking system has twice fully engaged bringing the vehicle to a stop when no apparent obstruction or vehicle was observed. fortunately both times nobody was behind me. the 1st incident occurred on a city surface street at night. upon returning the next day i saw metal plates placed in the roadway at same location for construction purposes. at the time i suspected the plates caused the emergency braking system to trigger unexpectedly. a several weeks/months later the system again fully triggered when crossing a railroad track on a city surface street. i assumed something on the crossing triggered the radar, although have crossed many times since without incident. both times the braking system engaged there was little to no warning it was about to, just very rapid beeping and immediate brake engagement. i have also had multiple instances where the radar begins to trigger apparently due to fence posts or similar items along roads, but does not engage the brake. i have also had messages the collision sensor has turned itself off only to turn itself back on several hours later or after the car has been shut down and restarted.    the emergency braking system should be fixed as the sudden stop should you be in traffic could easily result in an accident and may even cause whiplash among pssengers if traveling at a high rate of speed."
"on 4 different occasions, the automatic braking has engaged for no reason while i have been driving. luckily each one of the times i was not driving freeway speeds. also, countless times i get an error message saying that something is obstructing the sensor, but there are no obstructions. this has got me worried and dont feel safe."

"when i turned my car on i got an alert that said ""steering assist fault service required"". i tried to back up but the steering wheel was completely stiff so i turned my car off. when i turned it back on the power steering returned. i have read a lot of complaints about the same issue online, and i am confused as to why there isn't a recall on the power steering yet."
"about  two weeks ago while driving straight on a city street in dry conditionat a steady speed the esc light on my dash came on and would not go out until i had parked the car for some time and restarted it. the light then came back on again after about 5 minutes of driving, this time it was accompanied by the electric power steering warning light which began to flash orange, then was solid orange and then flashed between orange and red.  when the electric steering light is orange the steering assistance is reduced when straightening after cornering, however when it is red there is no power assistance and this condition can happen at any speed and at anytime without warning.  now yesterday(7/14/2019) when driving at 40mph in a straight line in the dry, the engine fail! workshop now!, esp,epc, electro steering, cel and abs warning lights came on accompanied by a chime and the speedo went from 40 to 0 and back up again while in motion. quite disconcerting to have all that happen at once. after all the lights went out the vehicle seemed to be ok until i attempted to pull out of a gas station at which time with the vehicle in drive i pressed the accelerator and the revs went up but the vehicle did not move until the third attempt.  i have read on line that this maybe a result of an abs module failure but my vin doesn't pull up any recalls and my vehicle is out of warranty.  not only does this sound like it will be an expensive repair, it is also a hugh safety issue!  unfortunately i don't have any pictures as it is completely random and not safe to try and take pictured while driving."
"vehicle frequently shakes/shudders violently under light/normal acceleration in stop-and-go traffic, creating a safety hazard and extremely uncomfortable driving situation. i purchased it a few weeks ago and have approximately 1300 miles on it - this has been happening since i took delivery. under load, shortly after the transmission shifts and as the vehicle reaches approximately 9-11 mph at 2000rpm, the entire vehicle shudders as if the engine is being lugged or is misfiring. this really only occurs after the vehicle has had sufficient time to warm up and has been driven for some time in rush-hour traffic. it is more pronounced with the adaptive cruise control turned on. the shaking/shuddering has made me extremely dizzy and nauseous to the point where i have already become physically sick to my stomach once. i had to cut off 3 lanes of traffic to reach the shoulder so i could avoid getting sick in the car - this was on 7/8/2019, a week ago today. several passengers will no longer ride in the car with me. i have returned the vehicle to the selling dealer twice over this issue and although their efforts to diagnose it were made in good faith, they have been unable to reproduce it. i have several videos of this issue that i attempted to share with the dealership upon dropping it off the second time, which the service technician told me he did not view after i picked the car up. i also recently discovered that my emergency communication/airbag deployment notification system (car-net), is completely non-functional due to a software bug and will not work at all until volkswagen comes up with an update for it (per the dealer). i am extremely uncomfortable continuing to drive the vehicle for these reasons and continue to feel sick to my stomach every time i use it to commute to or from my job, which is just over 30 miles from my home."
"this has been happening for a few years now-normally i can turn vehicle off and then on again and the electric power steering assist fault error will go away. now this error doesn't go away and there is no power steering. when this first started to happen it was taken to the ford dealer and they said it was not an issue, if i go online i see numerous people with this same issue with little results from ford. i am so disappointed in ford for not taking responsibility.  not sure what i will do the garage is going to try to reset the electrical system, they said 50/50 chance it will work."
"turned a corner while braking, the engine died, ""service stabilitrac soon"" illuminated on the instrument panel; driving down the road pulling a light weight boat trailer, the engine died but came back on immediately and the ""service stabilitrac"" illuminated; pulled into a parking lot and as i turned about halfway through the turn the engine died and ""service stabilitrac soon"" illuminated.  i took to the truck to the chevrolet dealer and they diagnosed the positive battery terminal was loose and the positive cable had too much resistance - $507.00 later and approximately 10,000 miles later reared it's ugly head again.  coming back from a morning drive to the lake and the 'service stabilitrac' light illuminated but the truck didn't die, a little further down the road it did the same thing and died but started right back up on its own while driving, started to back into my driveway and it died in the middle of the road, turned the ignition off and attempted to start it two or three more times, nothing!!!  it's like there was no battery installed.  every time this happens i lose steering, the brakes seem to fade but i am able to stop on the slow turns like into the parking lot.  in all instances the vehicle was moving.  one time i noticed an increase in the a/c  speed within the cab and the 'service stabilitrac' illuminated but as soon as i turned about half way into a parking area, it died, but continued to pick back up on the engine running.  the local dealer had also perfomed some service bulletin regarding the campaign for 'loss of steering assist' at 19,340 miles.  the vehicle currently has 42,000 miles..... the date ""when did this happen"" was today 7/16/2019 but the other times were various before this date."
as others described. while driving the power steering stops.  pull over and restart the engine and the steering assists comes back.  this has been happening for a year intermittently about 6-8 weeks apart.  this week it happened but the steering assist has not returned.
the emergency braking system activated on its own and bring the vehicle to dead half when nothing is in front of me
"while driving, my power steering randomly goes out, luckily i was parking when it did, but the message pops up as -steering assist fault-. now i would have been worried if it wasnt for the fact that it would work for short periods of time then randomly cut off in the middle of driving, got me once on a turn almost causing me to crash. not sure if there is a real difference with the other focuses but mines a 2013 ford focus se hatchback."
"this is about my 2018 honda cr-v ex with around 14,700 miles at present.my whole family and a friend went to yakima,wa for cherry picking.on our way there from seattle,wa while driving using adaptive cruise control (acc) and lane keeping assist system (lakas) suddenly a warning from the screen appeared that says...""power reduced - power grille problem"" and then we can not accelerate the speed. luckily we made it to the shoulder of the highway for emergency park and wait for 5 to 10 minutes until the warning goes out from the screen. when it goes out we start the engine and start driving again and after 7 to 10 minutes the warning goes on again ,stop and goes again for the third time and we decided to turn off the acc and lkas and drive in a lower speed 60 to 65 mph in a 70 mph  speed limit zone.the next morning i checked the engine oil fill compartment and the engine oil dipstick and found out they have a strong gasoline smell.gasoline leaks to the engine oil compartment.when i checked the dipstick , the oil is dripping like water with blackish color because of the gasoline mixed to the oil.     i reported it to the dealership for service and told me not to drive the car going to them instead the towing company (aaa) do the job to take it to the dealership.and the day when i picked up the car they told me that the gasoline i smell from the compartment is normal due to combustion. i asked them to check the engine oil dipstick to prove to them that it smells gasoline and dripping like water with blackish color (this is a newly changed pure synthetic engine oil /90% remaining).they did not check the dipstick and told me they can do nothing about it and told me to it's normal.they said it's safe to drive my car.     i'm just hoping this problem be resolved very soon."
"driving down the hwy with cruise control on suddenly get errors listed below, has happened twice. errors automatically clear after car is turned off and back on. cruise control and other sensing features unavailable while errors show on dashboard.  errors: brake system, adaptive cruise control problem, road departure mitigation system problem, collision mitigation system problem.  car has approximately 22k miles."
my steering wheel locks up and the dash reads power steering assist default. mainly does it when i first start car and put it in reverse but it has done in while driving making a turn.
"while turning, steering became very difficult and dangerous.  the steering assist went out and there was no power steering.  this could potentially be dangerous situation leading to an accident."
twice this week as i would come to a stop light a notification would come up in the dashboard saying something regarding the steering assist and all of my lights would come on inside the dashboard then the car would shut off i don't exactly know what causes it so turn back on but i would turn it on and off and the first couple times it would just click then all of a sudden it'll crank back up. i'm about to have a chile so this is very concerning for me.

"i was driving at approximately 30 mph when my vehicle's automatic emergency braking system engaged.  there was no apparent obstruction which would have caused the aeb system to engage.  i've owned the vehicle for exactly 1 week and this has happened twice.  both times, the system engaged for approx 2-3 seconds and then my car returned to normal driving.  while it did not bring me to a full stop, it did slow me down and created fear, distraction and a major safety issue all while actively driving with my toddler in the vehicle."
"a safety critical incident occurred on my new 2019 mazda 3 hatchback when the vehicle when into ""limp"" mode while adaptive cruise control was engaged at highway speeds leading to rapid deceleration. the vehicle was towed to the nearest manufacturer service location where a diagnostic was performed. codes show that communication between the central vehicle processor and multiple sub-processors failed simultaneously. comments were made by manufacturer service representatives that failure mode is likely different from the recent cylinder deactivation/rocker arm recall. service representatives were instructed to simply clear the codes and drive the vehicle to attempt to reproduce the failure during which it did not occur. i have attached a sanitized version of the service receipt to this message with the full list of codes.    unfortunately mazda's representatives were unable to provide any explanation on why this failure occurred or what will be done to prevent it in the future. engineering analysis will need to be performed to reach an acceptable conclusion. environmental factors relating to the incident include a very hot outside air temperature, with a reading of 115 deg f from the vehicle's sensor roughly 15 minutes before the incident. the incident also occurred on a very long section of us highway with a consistent, gradual incline.    given that information potential causes are intermittent computer hardware failure in high temperature environments, or a software error in power train control or cruise control causing a communication bus failure. with the age and mileage of the vehicle (336 mi) the potential for this failure occurring is likely present in a large portion of new mazda vehicles."

"my vehicle has missing structural adhesive on the front driver side suspension strut tower. it appears the robot that bonds the pieces of metal together with adhesive either had an air bubble in the line when this vehicle was made or there was some other defect. in addition, the transmission shifts extremely rough and nothing has been done by honda to correct the issue. i also had to have bubbles fixed in the paint on the trunk lid. the adaptive cruise control is nearly impossible to use because it does not detect vehicles ahead and accelerates rapidly or applies the brakes abruptly for no reason. american honda was notified of the defect in the suspension strut tower adhesive but refused to send an engineer to look at the car. in my opinion, any missing structural adhesive used to join metal, especially on a highly dressed place such as the strut tower, could easily become a safety defect.  i would prefer my vehicle be bought back from honda as it appears to be a lemon."
power steering assist fault  happened intermittently at first but last time i started my car a week ago the error persists and my car now has no power-steering capabilities. this is a known issue with the power steering racks shorting out. i shouldn't be responsible financially to  for this repair as 2011 fusion  to 2013 we recalled for this problem. my car has the same engine so the recall needs to be expanded. luckily i wasn't driving when this happened thus causing an accident!

"just received a letter from general motors with a page that is to be inserted into my owners manual. the issue it purports to solve is that the manual states that if this truck has forward collision alert, it also has forward automatic braking & intelligent brake assist. that is incorrect & this alert is to correct that error.  but, the manual insert provided is nonsense. it has no page number to tell us where to insert the new page; there are 2 sections relating to this in the manual. the insert also says it only applies to 1500 series trucks. mine is a 2500 series. so why send this. gm has messed this up and it seems to me you need to call them on it to provide correct inserts for the 2 manual areas to which it applies. that should include correct information and page numbers. otherwise the material i received is irrelevant to correcting the original error. i am a retired government performance auditor, so serious mistakes in correcting problems concern me."

"sudden loss of power steering assist while driving vehicle. found that a recall for this failure was in place. taken to the dealership and because the part (power steering motor) had been replaced previously they said it would not be covered. called the gm line and once more they wouldn't give an answer even after talking to the supervisor. vin does not show up in the recall lookup, but the vin number falls within the range of covered vehicles on the official bulletin. in my opinion, replacing a defective part with another defective part is not honoring their recall.    2010 pontiac g5    bulletin no.: 10023  recall no.: 10v073000  recall date.: 03/03/2010  vin: [xxx]    date of failure: 08/01/2019    part: power steering assist motor  newest part #: 19368293  they have changed the part # numerous times. (which i believe indicates a recurring issue)    when calling the gm line they could not give a complete answer. talked with the supervisor, who said it had to be discussed with the dealership's service advisor. i requested what the answer would be if it was confirmed that it was the same issue that was specified on the recall and still they refused to give me any clear information.    basically, it came down to either spend the $205 for the part and replacing myself, or gambling another $200 to take it in and have it possibly covered. ($400 quoted for parts and labor.) i chose to replace myself.    their records show that this car has had the recall repair performed installing the newer ""fixed"" part. but having the exact same defect happen still very early in the parts lifetime makes me question how many cars they claim to have fixed that still have this failure hazard. there is no warning, power steering assist just suddenly stops.    thanks, [xxx]    information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6).  *tr"

my 2015 ford taurus was operating under normal conditions when two warnings appeared on the dash. one for a steering assist fault and one for an advancetrac service being required. i was driving on a country road as this occurred and approaching a sharp curve.  as these lights illuminated the power steering was lost while operating at speeds about 60 mph. luckily i was able to safely bring the vehicle to a stop. when i went to the ford dealer today they advised that that this is a common issue with fords electronic power steering systems and that extended coverages are available on some models to replace the faulty items however the 2015 taurus is not covered. i work in law enforcement so i am a well trained driver and it is because of said training that i was able to avoid a collision when this system failed however it is extremely dangerous and i would be fearful that this could happen to a less trained driver and have catastrophic results.
"the power steering assist failure engages and i cannot steer my car   steering just fails! cannot turn steering wheel at all while traveling at 40 mph  could have resulted in a horrible accident i was unsuccessful at getting off the road but turned the car off and restarted it it was ok for a bit however after researching several 2010 owners have the same problem and only recalls were issued for 2011 owners its costs 1800.00 to repair at dealership  i am afraid to drive my car. i literally could not budge the steering wheel. i was not turning a corner at the time i was headed straight, with a curve ahead of me. the car has only 75k miles has always been well taken care of."
intermittently the steering wheel will tighten at low speed in reverse.  steering assist fault appears on the dash.  nearly impossible to steer once this occurs.  happened pulling out of the driveway twice today in reverse.
brake lights do not illuminate when adaptive cruise control applies them; brake lights do function normally on manual braking. the apparent design flaw of brake lights failing to illuminate when adaptive cruise control applies the brakes violates the safety principle of brake lighting altogether. such a design should not be allowed on the road as it could lead to increased collisions under certain conditions. this condition is observed to happen consistently.
"while moving at both highway speeds or speeds between 20 -40 mph, the emergency braking system would engage without warning and without an object in front of the vehicle.    this would cause the brakes to engage, the vehicle to shudder until i could re-take control, and an error alert on the dash board.  the dealer's recommendation was to turn off the radar assisted emergency braking every time i got into the vehicle, as it was a ""flawed technology"".  after multiple events and trips to the dealer, they replaced the part and updated the software."
"while driving on a public roadway, the power steering assist began to diminish causing a need for increased physical effort to steer the vehicle while an unusual noise (hissing) was detected from the engine compartment area. examination at an authorized vw service facility revealed a power steering fluid leak from the left side steering rack bellows requiring a total steering rack replacement at a cost of $1,886.89. vehicle odo was 58,734 miles at the time of this repair."

emergency braking system slammed brakes on car going 10 mph down a paved road in good weather conditions.  this is the second time and my car only has 1400 miles.
"the power steering high pressure line leaks in multiple places through a short canvas reinforced rubber segment on my 2006 corvette, not through any crimped fittings, o-rings, etc. the higher the rpm, the faster it leaks. it sprays on the engine and exhaust. the source of the leak was difficult to find shortly after purchase (used), being the hose itself is hard to see, the leak was smaller then, and it had a corrugated plastic tubing wrapped around it for abrasion protection, diverting the leaks. now it's leaking badly. the hose is bent in a curve, and the leaks are all along the outer perimeter (stretched) side of the hose. i discovered the replacement steel line has been redesigned to a longer unit with two straight rubber sections that must be rerouted, which told me the original had a design flaw that led to failures. i checked to see if there was a recall for this, and there is, but oddly my vin seems to 'not be included'. recall #05v455000 is dated 10/5/2005, and the date my car was built is 09/05 according to the door decal. the recall states: 'consequence: if this were to occur, power steering assist would be lost and increased steering effort would be required. on vehicles equipped with hydro-boost power brakes, it could also result in loss of power brake assist and increased braking effort would be required. if the power steering fluid spray were to spray onto hot engine parts, an engine compartment fire could occur.'  the dealership insists my vin is not effected, but yet i clearly have this problem now on a hose that is nothing like the newly-designed ones. i think gm must include my vin and all additional ones with this old style hose installed, i think it 'slipped through the cracks'. it's spraying fluid on hot exhaust beneath, and it loses lots of fluid quickly which can lead to steering/brake failure. i can't drive the car in the state it's in."
"i was driving down a road going 35 mph and suddenly the automatic braking system engaged causing the vehicle to slam on its brakes almost completely stopping. there was no advance warning that this was going to occur (e.g. sound or dashboard alert). further there were no cars in front of me, no pedestrians, or anything else that could have caused the front collision automatic braking to engage. thankfully there was no vehicle immediately behind me or they would have surely crashed into me."
"driving on highway adaptive cruise control engaged. skies are grey. it's about 1300. no rain. in right lane. 2 cars ahead exited and cruise control did not see the white truck ahead of us who was slowing down for traffic. the car increased speed, accelerating into the back of the truck. we applied our breaks and avoided an accident going from about 50 mph to the slow traffic speed of about 20 mph in 10 yards. it was quite scary. i similar incident with the car not seeing a white truck happened about a year ago in stop and go traffic driving through seattle."
"our ""network"" components were not working.  at high speeds, the adaptive cruise control would not brake properly and could have caused an accident.  the ""brake"" sensor is not working properly.  upon taking to dealer for service, service technician said that this ""network"" issue has occurred on other cars.  strongly recommend an immediate inquiry to this issue as it affects the safety features touted by the car manufacturer, honda.  the solution is to reconnect the network components, this has still not resolved our issue."

"my family was leaving a parking lot and when the car was started up the steering would not work properly. it would not turn without a lot of difficulties. a message came on that said: steering assist fault. service required. we had to get to an airport and we were stuck in a parking lot. we went online to see if others had this problem and if there was a solution. we saw that others had this problem. one solution we read was to let the car sit a bit and then try again. we did this and each time it was still very hard to turn the steering wheel.    finally, after waiting a little longer i started the car and it seemed to be able to move but was still very difficult to steer. after circling the parking lot a few times we decided to try to get to the airport on time. i drove and it was very difficult but i was very careful and we got there and then home, several hours of driving.    i took the car to a local mechanic who said that with only 58,000 miles on the car it should not have that problem and that he could fix it for up to $2,000 but that he would recommend that ford should pay for it and that i should take it to a ford dealer and contact ford to pay for it.    i took it to the local ford garage who was very accommodating but were unable to pay for it. i then called the ford company phone and the person told me they would not pay for it at all but that i should keep my receipt in case they later would pay if many were affected.    i got the car fixed for $2,155. that was for: 1 hv6z 3504 ep gear asy - steering, and also for an alignment which they said was needed because of replacing what they had in the steering.    i had tried to start the car at various times and the error message always came up and it always steered hard. i'm glad it didn't go out on me when i was driving as i see has happened with some people. ford should pay for this."

"2013 ford explorer sport - my vehicle is having dangerous steering issues. my vehicle is appears to be experiencing an intermittent  power steering failure.  while driving the vehicle at any speed there appears to be steering loss.  there also appears to be loss of steering when at different steering angels.  it appears to shut down the power that is being sent to the power steering assist.  this fault happens when in any location, highway, parking lot, local street, city street, etc.  the issue happens randomly at all speeds and sometimes when the vehicle is stationary.  the most discouraging aspect of this problem with the vehicle is that ford had recognized the same exact problem with the same make and model vehicle of mine, that were only built just months before mine.  it is also disappointing to see that ford is not even looking into the issue (as told by customer care representative in the philippines)."

"my (and my son's) 2013 hyundai elantras both have begun exhibiting the failure process that will inevitably result in the loss of the ""electronic assist"" power steering.  our hyundais now have a vague dead-spot in the steering when the steering wheel is moved off center at any speed. you can feel it the most when the vehicle is parked. the ""dead-spot angle is getting wider and wider as the rubber slip-joint part inevitably disintegrates this rubber bushing is a shear device between the mechanical steering shaft and an electric motor that powers the hyundai's steering rather than traditional hydraulic pump power steering found on most cars. my neighbor's hyundai went fully through the failure process that resulted in no power assisted steering and a very expensive repair.  the failure of this $1.25 (retail) part is so common in many hyundai models like the elantra, that the parts department keeps a box of them constantly on hand for the inevitable failure of this part in every hyundai model that uses it.  it's a huge profit producer for their service department, so i can understand their reluctance to redesign this part. however, i can't currently afford the hundreds of dollars of labor charge that hyundai demands for the replacement of this defectively designed part, so i don't let my wife drive the car because she might not be able to react to the loss of steering assist at high speeds.  i drive the car as little as possible.  hyundai is well aware of this defect and had a recall for the same problem on 2010 models but ended the recall when they probably told the nhtsa that they corrected the part.  in actual fact, they didn't fix the inherent defect and if you do a search online you will see that many people are still being endangered by this defect."

the problem i been having is with the steering. when you turn the steering wheel suddenly or just kinda fast the steering assist will lock up and all of the dashboard and ac will shut off and than restarts. not all the time but about 6 times the engine shut off completely. this is a very serious and dangerous situation that it puts you in this can happen when stationary when you trying to pull out on the highway or at slot speed when trying to turn  this happens all the time

"i have a 2012 ford explorer that was included in the safety recall 14s06.  the pscm was reprogrammed prior to me purchasing the vehicle.  associated to recall 14s06 is the extended coverage program 15n01, which is to remain open on the vehicles that were recalled in the event that any loss of steering assist dtcs are present.  my explorer has a complete loss of power steering and the dealer has noted that my entire steering gear assembly must be replaced.  ford refuses to acknowledge extended coverage 15n01.  this coverage is supposed to last for 10 years and 150,000 miles.  i am at 144,000 miles.  ford continues to repeat that my car is not included in the special coverage.  however, publications from ford indicate otherwise.  replacement of my steering gear is $2,200.  all of which should be covered by ford.  my power steering and stabilitrak warnings go off and i lose power steering while driving.  this is a safety issue that needs to be addressed correctly by ford.  ford's customer care department is severely incapable of answering the most basic questions. they are also incapable of accurately documenting what you have called about making it impossible to reach any resolution or provide information beyond what you research on your own.  i requested escalation and was told that they don't have bosses, won't escalate my request for additional information or provide original recall notifications for my vin.  i was told the only way to pursue the issue further was to write a letter."
"i recently bought a 2004 saturn ion 1 from a private party. i was not aware that there is a recall on the the elecrtic power steering assist. the dealer in my area says the recall has expired and they are refusing to fix it. i bought this car may 2019 used every dollar i had to buy it. im a single mother of 4, i live in a small town there is nothing for jobs here. i work part time at a fast food resturant and can barley afford to feed my family. i just spent 2000.00 on this car and cant risk driving it now that this is an issue. i have kids to get back and forth to school and a job to report to everyday i need my car fixed asap."
"under certain lightning or glare conditions, the cr-v's automatic braking comes on. it recently happened to me on three occasions. in the first it was on the t. r. bridge, leading into dc, at 7 am, when the sunlight from the east was causing glare. the cr-v braked automatically while going at about 45 mph when there was no vehicle in front of mine. in the second and third instances, it was when i was on i-66 east on the overpass over the capital beltway at 8:30 pm traveling at about 55 mph. the cr-v's ""brake"" warning came on when there was no vehicle in front or next to the vehicle. the glare from the overhead lighting for the highway signs is quite strong in that location. this is a serious safety issue, since the vehicle can brake without warning in the middle of a highway at highways speeds, potentially causing the driver to lose control or to be rear ended at high speeds."
adaptive cruise control was engaged at a stop light. when the car in front moved adaptive cruise would not disengage. there was at least 30 feet clearance to the next object.     cruise was turned off and the brakes released.

"each time i use cruise control and completely out of the blue, the car will suddenly slow down and an indicator lane light will come on. i never use the lane assist so that is not the problem - i checked that first. hands are on the wheel, attention is fully on the road and there is no driver error. i will be cruising along and the car suddenly (very suddenly!) will slow down - almost as if the engine was shutting down. i'm no longer using cruise control because of the potential danger.     in addition to this issue, the virtual cockpit will go black and never works consistently i.e. the bluetooth connection and apple car play. i've spoken to my dealership and they said to call audi connect. still no solution as to why the problem happens. very frustrating."

"have had this vehicle to dealer multiple times with complaint of hearing rattling under vehicle and in steering column along with noise from right front brake area.  also with complaints of vehicles wandering left and right on highway regardless of road crown.  have asked specifically to check the electric steering to ensure not faulty.  all these complaints while still under original warranty.  today, two weeks after last visit, steering locks up while driving and i cannot turn the vehicle.  fortunately, i was on my property going slow and was able to stop safely.  i was driving home and drove 30 miles on the interstate doing 70mph.  glad the steering did not freeze then.  shut the vehicle off and then restarted it and got the 'steering assist fault service required' on the cluster along with a bunch of other symbols.  the sync screen came up and froze and could not be cleared nor was it responsive to any other selections on screen.    i think this is an electrical issue with either the electric steering, a sensor or possible low or interrupted voltage.  this vehicle has no voltage gauge for battery nor was there any indicator that warned of a low voltage issue when the steering wheel would not turn.    is nhtsa waiting for someone to be killed with this problem before it is investigated?  i am waiting until monday when dealer opens to have them come get this vehicle.  i am afraid to even attempt to do anything to it to drive it to dealer for service.  i am uploading the latest service invoice for this issue.  dealer has consistently stated there was nothing wrong."

"while driving at highway speed (70mph), the oil pressure suddenly dropped from a normal 55+psi to about 15psi and the engine started to vibrate bad and run eradically. slowing down and stopping, it felt like it was going to stall making it much, much harder to steer the vehicle and slow down due to the lack of vacuum created by the engine to assist with the power brakes and rpm's needed to provide power steering assist. oil pressure dropped to about 5psi at idle. no knocking sound from the lower end of the engine, just valvetrain tapping/ticking. this vehicle needs towed. this is a low mileage vehicle-well under 100k miles and documented care. there are many, many hemi equipped vehicles on the road and at dealerships that have these related timing chains breaking / timing chain tensioners breaking and failing, camshaft and lifters grinding themselves away but, very few are reported as either tsb's or recalls. this is potentially a very deadly and dangerous issue and should not be taken lightly!!! extremely dangerous!!!"

"having issues with transmission (hard shifting, not going into gear, not going into park). this started within a few thousand miles of owning the car. the power steering also goes out at random times. the car gets significantly harder to steer, or turn. happens when lane departure is turned off as well.  also the adaptive cruise as constantly failing. almost like the camera just stops working, and the entire system shuts down, or it says its still engaged and cant see the cars in front slowing down. sometimes the heads up display alert doesn't even go off when it should.  not sure if this is an electrical issue, or each individual system has problems. car has been at the dealer about 6 times now with the same issues. they currently have the car, and have had it for about 25 days now.  always the same outcome... ""we don't know how to fix it"".  they even had a specialist come in and reprogram the transmission to try to ""fix the problem"".  it hasn't fixed the problem yet. transmission issues usually happen stationary, going from drive to park, sometimes you will get a loud and very hard shift into gear, sometimes it says its in drive or reverse, you take your foot off the brake, and tap on the gas and nothing happens. it acts as if its still in park. it would also say ""shift to park"" after you already have and wont let you turn off the car, until it registers you in ""park"".  as for the adaptive cruise, it happens while in motion. its gotten to the point where i cant even use it anymore. it may work for 3 miles, then completely shut down.  steering issue happens whenever it feels like it. sometimes while parked, sometimes while driving.  doesn't seem to matter speed wise."

"this vehicle has the pro-pilot assist which keeps the vehicle between the lines centered. it is an auto steer.  we have had numerous times where the steering will go from line to line, it will cross the line put you on shoulder, cross the center or even move you into another lane with traffic in it.     we have complained to dealership, they took it for a week said they found nothing wrong. within 24 miles of getting it back it was doing it again. they said unless the engine light is on ( for engine code) they will do nothing.   this is a feature used mostly on highway at highway speeds.    this issue is most dangerous, at highway speeds if it does this could cause a multi vehicle collision resulting in serious injuries or death.   i cannot pinpoint certain dates as it has happened enough where my wife will not use it."
1 . after a left turn the vehicle continues to pull left (measured at about 4 pounds of force on the steering wheel to hold straight) until a right turn is made to cancel the left pull then it tracks straight.  there were similar results on right turns but worse on lefts.  2 . these tests were also done on another new ford platinum expedition identically equipped with the same results (both with heavy duty tow package)  3 . the new expedition above did seem to require a little less right corrective pressure than our expedition but the left pull was approximately the same  4 . these tests were done with and without lane keeping with no change to the results   5 . these tests were done with and without sway control with no change to the results  6 . approximate trailer weight 6000 lbs. and approximately 600 lbs. tongue weight  7 . during the left pull the vehicle will 'blow' through the lane keeper on the left but works ok on the right  8. tests were also made with a totally different trailer and hitch system with the same problem.  9. the tests were done with and without load transfer bars.  the left pull remained after a left turn but was a bit less without the load transfer bars attached (that was surprising).  10. ford has replaced the entire steering system (including rack and pinion unit with steering control module and yaw sense module) after they checked all wheel alignments with no improvement in steering problem.  11. this problem also happens with no trailer in tow just not to the same extent.  12. ford has now refused to do anything more to resolve the steering problem.  note: i do have video for this problem on the road.
"on two separate occasions, to include the morning of september 27, 2019, when the 2013 ford explorer was turned on, an error message stating 'power steering assist fault' appeared on the dashboard screen. the vehicle was stationary at the time of the error message. the power steering was disabled and it was extremely difficult to turn the steering wheel. we contacted ford about the issue and we were told there was a recall for the 'power steering assist fault' for the 2013 ford explorer but our vehicle was not included based on the vin. even though the issues we are experiencing are identical to the recall, we must incur our own expenses to have it fixed. the vehicle currently has 105,000 miles"
"when is in motion on any type of street and also at a stop, when getting close to a vehicle or if someone cuts in front of me, or if there is a street sign directly in front of the car, this message appears very briefly ""unavailable front radar obstruction"" which also shows the icon of two front end of cars colliding. this happened immediately after puchasing my 2018 maxima.  the dealership has not said a word about being aware of this problem when it is a known problem with certain nissan vehicles.  the cost to bring it into the dealership and for any repairs at this point would be out of my pocket since the car is no longer under warranty.  this faulty radar compromises the emergency braking system in the car."
"initially noticed subtle issues with steering while driving on a city street and interstate, followed by a warning message on my dash board stating 'power steering assist fault'. power steering completely went out temporarily, leaving no option but to put the truck in park, and turn the vehicle off. dealership stated the entire steering rack needed to be replaced due to this being an electronic system. when researching, it appears many other ford vehicles have had this issue, and not just with f150s. other years were recalled due to this same electronic power steering design, just not my year. appears this is the same faulty design."
"while driving on the highway to work my steering suddenly locked up and jerked and then i got multiple alerts and lost power steering. the alerts were ""service advancetrac"" ""steering assist fault service required"" ""hill assist not working"" ""service battery charging system"" and there were two traction control lights. after work the traction control lights and alerts were still on and i did not have power steering on the drive home."
"tl* the contact owns a 2019 mercedes a220. the contact stated that the lane departure warning indicator failed to operate. while driving 50 to 60 mph, the steering wheel shook and the lane departure system prevented the contact from changing lanes. an icon illuminated on the instrument panel, indicating that the vehicle was leaving the road. also, the vehicle made an abnormal noise and the brakes engaged with a loud noise and canceled the lane change. the contact also stated that the road markings were solid lines and that was likely why the road departure system was more sensitive. the vehicle was taken to mercedes-benz bellevue (11850 bell-red road, bellevue, wa 98005, 425-455-8535) where it was determined that the lane change system activated for normal lane changes. the lane departure feature usually activated when driving over thick white lines, such as hov lanes. the failure occurred on the freeway during both day and night and was independent of the adaptive cruise control being engaged. the dealer test drove the vehicle and was able to duplicate the failure on another mercedes-benz 220. the vehicle was not repaired. the manufacturer was contacted. the failure mileage was 100. *pm*jb"
"driving on a 2 lane highway using autopilot the car accelerated and pulled left, ended up in the opposite lane and almost off road over a cliff. this is not the first incident i had with my tesla.   on several occasions, while using cruise control, it suddenly braked in the middle of the highway, while the immediate collision alarm went off. there were no vehicles in front of mine and no immediate risk for collision.   tesla needs to improve the autopilot features as there are significant safety concerns."
i was driving down the highway almost home when a 'power steering assist faulty' notification appeared in the dash. as i approached my driveway i realized i could barley turn to get out of the highway.    
"general motors llc (gm) is recalling certain model year 2006-2007 chevrolet malibu and malibu maxx vehicles manufactured april 1, 2006, to june 30, 2006, and 2006-2007 pontiac g6 vehicles manufactured april 18, 2006, to june 30, 2006. in the affected vehicles, there may be a sudden loss of electric power steering (eps) assist that could occur at any time while driving.    consequence  if power steering assist is lost, greater driver effort would be required to steer the vehicle at low speeds, increasing the risk of a crash."
"i bought a 2012 focus sel with 43000 miles on 1/15/2014. drove from nc. to ca. 2 months later and never had a problem then 6 months after having i would get random alerts saying ""steering assist failure"" but i could turn off the car and restarted it and it would go away. when the message came up you lost all steering assist and goes into manual. on thur. sept. 26, 2019, at 630am  as i starting driving doing about 25 mph it came n and i lost all steering. as i slowed down and started a turn the wheels locked up and went up the curb and hit a cinder block wall. no damage to the wall other then scrapped paint.    i have looked up this problem before and knew my time was coming but hoped ford would do the right thing and recall the focus as well as the other they did with the same problem. next step is reporting it to ntsb. i do not have the $3125.00 to fix this. you would have thought the car industry learned from the gm screw up but i guess not."
while driving the vehicles power steering will disengage! parked the vehicle after getting home safely the car now says power steering assist malfunction and the power steering does not work. i can not get any answers from ford!
"when making a wide or quick turn, the car steering wheel will lock up & while the car in motion & pull towards one side and dash lights will show up saying ""steering assist fault service required"" and i will not be able to take control of steering wheel unless i turn car off and then the dash light will turn off n not show up into problem occur again.. very dangerous n happy it happened when i got off the highway... 3rd time today it did this, sucks to not be able to feel safe driving your vehicle, cant drive it into this fix."
"steering assist fault... will lock your steering wheel while you driving your car.. its lots of complaints about this all over the internet will the 2016 ford fusion and it never got a recall for this... its dangerous, i thought it was brakes or wheel alignment but its a powering error."
"vehicle is equipped with automatic headlights that will turn on/off high beams. the high beams should turn on when conditions ahead are acceptable and off when oncoming traffic is present.  however, the automatic system frequently gets confused by oncoming headlights, turn signals and street lights, etc., which causes it to flash the high beams briefly at oncoming traffic.  on two occasions oncoming drivers thought this high beam flash was a signal to them to go ahead and they turned in front of me, nearly causing and accident. flashing high beams briefly is commonly done in our area to signal other drivers to go ahead.  the automatic high beams should be reprogrammed to prevent flashing them at oncoming traffic.  note that we have a different make/model vehicle with the same type of headlight system that works flawlessly without this problem."
"this been a problem since 2016 & its 2019... crazy it never been a recall for this situation and i read loads of comments of how people got hurt or almost got hurt from this & get rejected from ford on fixing the problem & not wanting to address it... this [xxx] not right & shouldn't be happening n be recalled immediately... if you having these problems please sign up to voice your complaint n don't just read it. more complaints the better chance of getting them to fix the [xxx] cars they [xxx] up n sell ppl... i'm scared to drive the only car & transportation i have to work because i fear me turning to hard or tight n the wheel locking up  while car in motion n i get into a accident n get killed... lucky it happened when pulling into a gas station... the steering wheel locked up and had no control over it... message show up saying ""power steering assist fault"" only way to fix this is to turn the car off n restart it & by doing that it's a temporary fix into u make another hard turn & [xxx] up part about it is that once u restart the car the light go off n message and will not show back up into the problem occur again making it hard to show proof... this need to be investigated & recalled.. no one have 2 or 3k sitting around to fix this [xxx] n not our fault.. people have this problem while they car have 30k miles... mine have 70k n have the problem... please make a account & voice the complaint one here & national traffic safety administration so this can be investigated & recalled.      information redacted pursuant to the freedom of information act (foia), 5 u.s.c. 552(b)(6).  *tr"

"i took a 3 hour trip up to my mother's house that weekend and then drove back another 3 hours and parked it for the night. i had no problems until i started my car up the next morning. a notice came on the dashboard saying ""steering assist fault service required."" the steering was extremely stiff and may as well have been locked. no check engine light or anything. so that would mean this happened overnight while the car was stationary and off. i took it to the dealer after unsuccessfully trying to find a basic fix and they said i needed to replace the whole rack and pinion assembly. i figure it happening overnight had something to do with the whole system being evenly soaked with heat from the long drive and cooling very slowly overnight causing cracks in the electrical components. it was a $3000 repair job for a car that had less than 37,000 miles on it albeit a 2015 model year. due to the warranty being out, i had to pay for this repair out of pocket. other people i've seen experience this had it fixed under warranty so they had no issues. unfortunately for me this was a used car and had no warranty left on it."
"the abs sensor system has failed on our car for the 2nd time . the first time it occurred on the left rear wheel in 2019. when the system fails it triggers a multitude of dashboard alerts which are extremely distracting. obviously the automatic braking will not function. the first occurrence was at 43, 705 miles. i was told by a vw dealer mechanic that this was likely to occur on the other wheels. unfortunately he was right. the abs sensor failed on the right rear wheel yesterday at approximately 61,000. safety features that include blind side monitoring are adversely impacted. the sensor alert occurs when starting the car and stays on while operating the vehicle. the cost for the repair is in the neighborhood of $300.00"

"vehicle was traveling westbound on i-90 in massachusetts in the travel lane at between 65-68 mph.  the cruise control was not engaged; the lane keeping assist feature was not active.  it was around 7:00 pm.  no cars in the passing lane.  a tractor trailer was about 200-300 feet in front.  the dashboard chimed and displayed the following three warning messages: collision mitigation braking system, adaptive cruise control, and lane keeping assist system.  the first time each message was displayed a chime sounded; the messages continued to rotate through the display for the next thirty minutes.  the messages stopped when we got home and put the car in the garage in park.  additionally, the light for 'brake system' (near the temperature gauge) came on.  i brought the car in today for service (it just happened that it was scheduled for an oil change); i told the service advisor about what had happened; the technician working on the vehicle said no codes were being displayed.  he took it for a ride but could not get the messages to come up (it only happened one time).  the service advisor said it was probably 'just a glitch'."
"received ""collision mitigation braking system problem. see your dealer."" error messages no less than 5 times. the 2019 accord touring has roughly 5k miles. i took it to the dealer the first time and restarted the car in the bay. the error light went away and they told me to come back if it happened again.  the error message came back several more times over the next several weeks. i scheduled an appointment. i suggested faulty brake switch be looked at but was told the car just needed a ""reboot"" and to call if i had any further issues. the issue returned several days later.  i believe in each case the adaptive cruise control was on and speeds were under 30. i believe the system was applying the brakes as we approached the car ahead in slow moving stop and go traffic.  only on one occasion was there rain or wet roadways.  in all other instances the road and skies were clear each time on relatively straight road."
"power steering assist fault.took a left turn on a main road in traffic and i hear ""dingdingdingding"" and the steering wheel pulled out of my hand and was fighting me to go straight, very heavily. almost went into oncoming cars as i tried to pull it back into the turn. almost hit a bus stop with people waiting, but i hit the curb. pinched a chunk out of the tire and scraped up the wheel. i looked it up and is same or similar to ford safety recall 15s18. my vehicle was made less than two months after the recall date limit, so ford claims it is not covered. i am just glad my wife was not driving it, especially with our kids in it. she could not have handled it and could have been very bad. there is no check engine light, no codes, nothing.just the warning displayed. then you press ""ok"" and it goes away with no more information."
"when starting the car in the mornings, a warning message appears on the dashboard: ""steering assist disabled"". the wheel becomes very hard to turn and it is not safe to attempt to drive. rather, i restart the car, and the message goes away. if this were to happen while i am driving, especially on the highway to get to school, it could result in a potential crash. this is very unsafe, and needs to be looked into."
i was involved in a car crash with the autopilot activated. the autopilot has a flaw where it cannot detect when a large vehicle like an 18 wheeler or cement truck in merging into the lane. it sees a large gap and while the front part of the vehicle is slowly snaking into the lane it starts to accelerate. i hit the side of a cement truck and had 8k in damages. i reached out to tesla without any response.

lost power steering.  the power steering will intermittently work and you will get a power steering assist fault notice. there is a recall for this issue (15s11) but for some reason this explorer was not included due to the manufacture date.  i believe that recall needs to be extended to cover all of the vehicles affected.   the vehicle is almost unsteerable when this happens and is not safe to drive.

"while driving with the cruise control engaged on my 2017 nissan murano, a message appears on dash: unavailable front radar obstruction.  the cruise control disengages at that point, requiring the driver to use the accelerator.  at that point, i think the automatic braking is also disabled.  the car currently has about 38000 miles on it and is 2 years old.  the frequency of the problem has increased over time.  i checked to make sure the sensor at the front bumper is clean.  this error will happen on days with no rain or snow.  at first, it errored when exiting a tunnel, but now it occurs randomly (but so far only when using cruise control).  since it is over the 36000 mile warranty, nissan requires a diagnosis from the dealer.  this is a safety problem that should have a recall.  i also recently rented a 2018 nissan altima while on vacation, and it was really bad.  it errored about every 5 minutes, even without cruise control.  nissan has a recall for the rogue model.  according to information on the internet, the problem is a sensor manufactured by bosch."

power steering assist light turns on which causes loss of steering capability.
"the issue is related to the honda infotainment system. after only 2000 miles the system began having issues. while the driver is driving, the center display and the display on the control panel will frequently go blank. when this happens the driver is unable to activate or deactivate specific safety controls including lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control and automatic braking. the automatic braking warning is also lost when the display goes out. the driver also loses the speedometer. from the center display, the driver is unable to use the backup camera, the radio, navigation and the ability to make hands free phone calls."

"at exactly two years old, the battery died. there is a service bulletin for a software update but of course, my vehicle didn't need update, it needed a new battery due to dead cell that happened within six hours. the top sides of the body has ripples down both sides. was told this is usually cause by roof rack (i don't have roof rack) or by car wash (my car has never been through a car wash. i won't even let dealer wash it when i'm there). the car brakes hard even when there is no obstruction in front of me. the cruise, lane assist, mitigation will all shut off at various times saying radar is off/blocked. on 10/08/19 while driving, the lcd screen started beeping, flashing and going black. nothing would work. car is becoming dangerous to be on roadway. filed complaint with honda on a couple issues. sorry for my luck, it's now out of warranty due to mileage."
"when driving, especially at highway speeds, the steering will unexpectedly push the car across the lane, sometimes harshly, especially around curves. this is more than a simple nudge for lane assist, it scares the heck out of you as you fight the steering wheel to maintain control. at least on our car it's enough to cause an accident!  the car has been in to subaru  three times to correct this problem, without success. after informing subaru of america and opening a formal complaint (case #148267253025) they dismiss this as the eye sight/lane assist working, and say the remedy is to turn this safety feature off...which to us is ridiculous and not why we purchased this car.  as we have informed subaru the car sits in our garage as we are simply too afraid to drive it.  our initial complaint was in july, after our first road trip,and the problem recurs irregularly and without warning.  the car now has 5725 miles on the odometer."

"while driving my 2004, mazda rx8 the electric power steering module failed, and jerked the car aggressively to the left into the oncoming lane of traffic. the force was so strong that it caused momentary loss of control. fortunately, there wasn't any oncoming traffic at that moment on that particular stretch of road. when reviewing the mazda forum there were several other owners that experienced the same loss of control or failure. additionally, mazda had power steering assist recalls for the same problems, ref. mazda3/mazda5 power steering recall notification 6010h."
"my tesla model 3 has a defect with autopilot sensors and sound.  when on autopilot (adaptive cruise control), the sensors can sometimes freeze up and or fail, causing autopilot to cease functioning and issue an audio alert.   however, system sound (blinkers, notification alert system) sometimes fails, thus preventing the autopilot from alerting the driver that it will no longer be breaking and or steering.    for example, i am driving using the autopilot cruise control, which is supposed to steer /brake/accelerate for me and instructed to keep eyes on the road, however, when the autopilot stops working as well as the audio notification, the driver will not know that it has failed and the car no longer brakes, thus making it likely to have a collision.      i have recorded the flaws and defects and have it on video.   this can happen anywhere, on highway or on a regular road.   tesla has been unable to fix the problem."

"my primary concern when shopping for this vehicle was safety, so instead of purchasing the comparable gmc denali, i chose the cadillac with the premium luxury trim level. the cadillac website advertised, and the autonation cadillac west palm beach salesman assured me, that the premium luxury package included 'low speed forward automatic braking.' this safety feature was important to me and was not available on the gmc denali.    after purchasing the vehicle, there were unrelated issues which prompted me to bring the car in for service several times. through that process, i learned that my vehicle was not equipped with 'low speed automatic braking' even though the rest of the features of the premium luxury trim level appear to be included. the service technician informed me during my last visit that my vehicle was not in fact equipped with 'low speed automatic braking.'    i write you this letter both as a frustrated consumer, but also as a concerned citizen. i can only wonder how many other customers are driving around thinking their vehicle is equipped with 'low speed automatic braking.' i escalated my concern to general motors in july 2019, but they denied my request to investigate this issue on july 17, 2019. i also contacted the dealership (autonation) but have been unsuccessful in resolving this as they have been largely unresponsive.   general motors and cadillac continue their deceptive advertising tactics to this day. if you to visit their website, you will find the  inconsistency between the different trim levels of this vehicle. the terminology is deceptive and confusing to the average consumer. there is a safety feature called 'low speed forward automatic braking' and one called 'forward/reverse automatic braking.' not only is the difference between these 2 features confusing to a lay person, but my salesman didn't know there was a difference.   *js"

steering assist fault. this issues is covered under several other recalls. my car has 77kmiles and should not be having steeting issues. my car was in motion and the power steering went out. i had to have it towed home and now have to replace a 700$ part due to fords parts issues. altering the media to this issue. ford should be responsible for issues and repairs as this is no fault on the drivers parts. i will be taking this up further if this i not handled and covered under a recall.

"on monday, october 14 my 2017 honda crv touring made a sudden stop on a perfectly clear day on the kelly ave bridge leading into my baltimore neighborhood. there was nothing in front of us or behind us.  the automatic braking system came on and the car slammed to a halt.  thankfully no one was behind us.  i really thought i had been hit from behind--it was extremely jarring.  i called honda corporate and filed a complaint and am taking the car in monday to the dealer so they can run a diagnostic check.  my service representative told me to clean my windshield as that was probably what caused the event to occur.  i was going approximately 25 mph--if we had been at highway speeds and a truck behind us it would have been a disaster."
"i started my car and i had 4 messages appear on the dash stating(service esc, service trailer brake, brake system failure-62 mph top speed and steering assist reduced drive with care).  i attempted to drive the vehicle in my neighborhood and noticed that i had lost power steering and when i went to brake there was a delayed response.  it took the vehicle approximately 4 to 5 feet to come to a stop after braking.  also the abs, check engine, brake and traction control lights were illuminated.  i immediately tried to drive back home and when i drove in to my driveway, i smashed on the brakes and i almost drove through my garage because the vehicle would not stop immediately.  i tried to press my onstar button for road assistance and lost all electrical power.  i contacted onstar with my phone and had the vehicle towed to the dealership where i purchased the vehicle.  currently the vehicle is there being diagnosed for the problem."

"there is an active recall 9/7/2010-2/28/2012 manufactured ford fusions.  which is for sudden loss of power steering.  my car was parked and when starting vehicle the 'power steering assist' message came on, i attempted to turn vehicle off and restart with no change.  vehicle has absolutely no power steering, can't steer, there is no functionality of any power whatsoever.  due to the fact my car's manufacturing date is 3/2010 it doesn't fall into the recall parameters, but however it is exhibiting the same exact issues notated in that recall."
"upon starting the vehicle the warning indicator ""power steering assist failure"" message appears and there is no power steering.  turning off and restarting sometimes resets the warning and power steering will return but not always.  there is a current recall with the same problems (14s06) but my vin falls outside the manufacture date.  reached out to fomoco and they verified there are no recalls and there have never been any recalls for my vin.  one month ago i received a recall letter from ford for a different issue that i had fixed under the recall by ford.  that recall didn't show up in fords database either for my vin when i called today but yet it existed and was fixed.  odd that the same power steering problem keeps occurring on vehicles but ford wont recognize the problem because of a build location and date.  ford doesn't engineer us spec vehicles based on their manufacturing plant, they seem to be saying that the same engineers that designed a faulty electric power steering motor for chicago didn't design a faulty motor for another plant.  or the original ""fix"" didn't real ""fix"" the problem."
turning the wheel to the right at low speed gave the message 'power steering assist fault'. drove home and parked. went to leave later and the power steering was completely gone. diagnosis at mechanic said it is power steering torque sensor.  contacted ford dealership was directed to ford canada. ford canada says we can't help you try your dealership. many calls later they find a document that says since i had the computer upgrade which prevents me from losing power steering while driving i am. or eligible for the replacement of the torque sensor which is covered in fords 14s05 recall of 'certain' ford escapes/mariners manufactured between april 2006 and september 2010 (mine is early 2010). mostly out of kansas. though what happened to me is exactly as described in the recall.  guess i shouldn't have had the software update?
while driving at low speed a chime went off and i lost the power steering.  the control panel said power steering assist.  i was able to safety pull over and get home.  it happens off and on and when i took in for service nothing could be found.  i am terrified to drive this car
power steering assist failure while driving.  complete loss of steering within seconds of warning on dashboard.  extremely lucky to have not caused a serious accident or death.  vehicle was driven into a parking lot with extreme difficulty and towed to a ford dealership for repairs.  verified as internal rack failure.  entire unit was replaced.  after research showing thousands of failures for this part this should be  safety recall before some one is seriously injured or killed.
the adaptive cruise control radar sensor was found crack after being taken to the dealership for error code. ( their was no physical damage to the front bumper or the bottom of the bumper of the vehicle.  gm failed to replace the part under warranty because they say there is physical damage to the part needed to be replaced. i believe the part should be in location where road debris can hit the part. service advisor has said this is known issue with this cadillac model.

"intermittent power steering assist fault light came on for a couple months randomly upon starting the vehicle. after turning the vehicle off then back on again it cleared the error and the sterring became easy. after a couple months of this when turning the vehicle on the error came again along with advancetrac error and the steering is gone and the errors codes stay. ford said the steering gear needs replacement and it's costing me $2,000 to fix. not sure why it's not under recall since it's the same issue as the others and it only has 39,000 miles on it. $2,000 is a ton of money."
"i was driving my 2018 honda crv on a city street between 25 and 30 mph when the brakes suddenly applied themselves and the car jerked forward very hard.  my foot was on the acclerator.there was no car, pedestrian of object in front of my car nor behind my car.  the weather was clear, no rain for several days.i think it was the automatic braking system. i called the dealer as soon as i got home. they are closed. i will be taking my car to the dealer first thing in the morning"

came out to start up my vehicle when immediately my power steering assist fault came on. it wouldnt allow me to back my car back nor turn my steering wheel as if it was locked. so i turned the car off feeling discouraged i may have waited 20 minutes and started the vehicle up to now there is no message. i proceeded to drive the vehicle once i made it back home the message came on once again at this time i took out my car book and it gave information on what the problem is and to seek service as soon as possible.

"subaru outback 2008 pulls to the left or right by itself intermittently.  when it happens, car speed is always > 45 mph and the issue is the most obvious on highways with a speed > 60 mph.  it feels like the steering has its own idea.  sometimes when i want to curve to the right, the steering turns by itself to the right and sometimes even stays there.  sometimes when i don't want to turn, it turns.  this is not related to lane assistance.  the feature is turned off and the issue happens when i drive in the lane.  i strongly feel unsafe and a bit nervous driving on the highway recently.  at the high speed, a slight turn may lead to serious consequences.  hope subaru could solve the issue.  a google search today showed that many other owners of the same model are experiencing the same, potentially damaging issue."
i have loss of electric power steering assist while driving and system defaults to manual steering mode. error code c1277 is the error code. the vehicle was in motion when the power steering went out. now every time we drive our car we have to do manual steering.     ford is refusing to fix my vehicle since it is not on the recall list. i am requesting that my vehicle be put on the recall list as i am having the exact issues others has complained about for power steering electrical issues.

"power steering assist fault goes on several times a week and is accompanied by a loss of power steering.  in fact, my steering tightens up so much that i don't think i could drive the car.  so far, this has only happened when i first start the car.  the steering returns to normal if i turn the car off, move the steering wheel from side to side sharply and then turn the car on again.  once i was able to get the power steering to work while the car was still running by just abruptly turning the steering wheel to one side.  i saw that some have had this happen on the freeway.  this has never happened to me, but i cannot imagine what i would do if it did.  i have a picture of the error message on my cell phone that i took on october 6, 2019.  my car had 129,839 miles on it at the time.  research tells me that this repair will cost $1440 or so, which is completely unaffordable for me.  why is this not recalled when it seems to be happening so often?  my friends do not feel safe driving with my anymore and refuse to ride with me.  i loved this vehicle, but i am beginning to rue the day that i purchased it.  i just put in $445.00 repairing some oxygen issue, the driver's side blinker, and the windshield wiper fluid lines.  i was given an estimate of $499.00 to replace my front passenger head light unit because it gets condensation in it and they can't just replace a seal.  however, none of these is the safety issue that i feel the power steering going out would be.  i feel ford should definitely be responsible for replacing/repairing this as so many have complained and the level of safety could be compared to the air bag recall. i had to pick one date below as to when it happened so i put the date i took the picture.  it has been going on for a couple of months, though."

"i have a 2017 golf r equipped with dsg transmission, automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. occasionally the car would make a continuous and periodic clicking noise that can last for a few minutes when in motion and when brake is not applied. as soon as i step on the brake, the clicking stops. when brake pedal is released, the clicking comes back. the problem started in may/june 2018 when the car had approximately 14000 miles, and has been doing that every once in a while since then. i brought it to a vw dealer in july 2018, but because this is an intermittent issue, they were unable to find out the root cause. there was no error code either. however they suspected that the noise was coming from certain relays in the abs / braking system, which is concerning as it could potentially be a safety issue.    a video of the problem can be seen here: https://streamable.com/pl4xk"

"i have had an ongoing issue with the aes(automatic braking system) indicator light for about a month.  it started when i had 300 miles on my car.  the sensor would randomly come on.  the 1st few times, the car would slightly break when the sensor would come on.  after awhile the sensor would just come on(which turns the whole system off when it is on) randomly with no braking.  i have taken to dealership 3 different times.  they have reprogrammed and replaced the sensor.  it happened again.  they then wanted me to make sure i put my car in garage for a week to see if it was related to moisture/fog on the windshield before they would replaced the front camera.  i humored them and did that.  to my dismay, i drove it and it got worse.  i was going down a highway and received front radar failure warning and the same indicator came on.  later, same day, i was going down the interstate passing a semi and a vehicle behind me and the same error.  this time it kicked the cruise control off and immediately slowed my vehicle down.  i was almost hit from behind.  this is a huge safety issue and the dealership should have just replaced the darn camera without me having to take this death trap home.  they promised me i was at no risk and then this happened!"
"yesterday i turned my car on and was alerted to a 'steering assist malfunction.' when this warning has come on before, i've turned the car off/on again and the wheel eventually unlocks. but yesterday the wheel stayed locked and i had to have it towed to ford dealership. dealership (visalia, ca ford) says they need to replace the steering gear assembly for close to $2800. they weren't aware of any recall for the issue. i've never had the warning come on while driving on surface streets or highways, but i believe it has come on as i've started my vehicle and put it in drive or reverse. my focus has approximately 130,000 miles on it."
when driving the car in certain situations the car will momentarily apply the brakes automatically rather hard for a period of a second or less. this occurs when on a highway and driving with the adaptive cruise control engaged and when passing a tractor trailer truck. it appears to happen only under certain situations such as sunlight angle and the color or reflection from the truck are interfering with the cars sensing  brakes can also be automatically applied rather hard when exiting a highway ramp without using a turn signal. this can happen without the adaptive cruise control applied so i suspect it is related to the collision avoidance feature.  i have owned this car since new and these events have occurred more then a dozen times. on a trip driving from florida to pennsylvania on rt 95 it happened about 5 times. very frightening to have the brakes applied spontaneously at 70 miles/hr when passing a truck.  i have asked about this during service at a honda dealer and they reported everything was working properly.

on many occasions my crv auto brakes hard and lane keep follows the wrong lines. 2 examples of braking: 1 - a pickup truck was making a right hand turn in front on me. as a human i started to go around him to the left as he turned but my auto brakes locked up and the person behind me came within inches from rear ending me then got road rage and chased me for something i did not do! could have been killed! 2nd was on a bend in the road - a white moving truck coming the other way on the bend made my auto brakes lock up hard / near a full stop! this happens often but not usually to these extremes. lane keep - while on a major highway with cruise and lk on i went thru a recent construction area and my honda started to follow old lines and painted over w/ black paint lines - not the new lines from after the repairs! it was scary - almost drove me into a barrier! on 1200 mile trip to florida my car often would hit the brakes for reasons i could not tell or go out of the normal road lines or the acc would slow the car to a crawl for trucks in the other lane. took it to the dealer - they say npf. one guy did say to adjust the sensitivity which i did but it still brakes when it should not. my wifes car does not react this way.

"on multiple occasions (when starting in driveway - stopped, while driving in parking lot - 5 mph, driving in town - 25 mph, while driving on highway - 60 mph) all advanced safety features are disabled including (but not limited to) eye sight (fab - forward auto brake, acc - adaptive cruise control, las - lane assist steering), rab - rear auto brake, rear cross traffic alert, blind spot detection, park brake, abs, traction control, power steering.  note that the failure of these systems does not cause a check engine condition and no error codes are logged.  the dealer indicated that the first 4/5 failures left no codes.  the next failure was delivered to dealer while running in a failed state.  dealer reported no codes found.  since the dealer did not report this to subaru i will be reporting this problem to subaru.

"steering assist unstable.  when suddenly turning the wheel, the tension in the wheel jumps - making it possible to turn sharper than expected.  problem seems to be internment - something stopping after driving a while. noticed issue while driving at low speeds in the city and while stationary.  may happen at higher speeds but don't turn at high speeds.  may happen if trying to avoid an accident."
"getting power steering assist code.  was able to turn car off and restart and it would clear thus allowing the steering wheel to turn as expected. but now it won't clear.  lucky i was able to drive car from 7-eleven to work which was not too far from my job.  when looking up issue on line i came across recall, but when i looked up my vin  it says there are no recall for my vehicle!!!  this is extremely dangerous, and can't understand how so many cars are experiencing the same problem yet recall is not being honored. again at high speeds this is very dangerous."

"sporadically upon startup i would get a power steering assist failure warning with car reverting to manual steering.  rebooting the car would clear the fault.  took it back to the dealer i purchased it from, they pulled codes and said they could not find a problem.       this happened every few weeks for the next year.   last week the fault reappeared accompanied by warning that advance trac needed servicing and did not clear with reboots of the vehicle.  car was still drivable with manual steering.  made appointment with jack madden ford in norwood, mass to have them repair the issue on 26 nov 2019.      i see that this exact set of failures matches recall #15v340000, but when i look up my vin, mine is not included in that recall.   sounds like the recall needs to be expanded."
"with the car parked overnight, i started the vehicle and put the transmission into reverse to exit my driveway. there was a loss of power steering.

"while driving, i heard a strange noise coming from the steering column. once i reached my destination and returned to my car and started it, the power steering assist warning light came on. i began to pull off, the vehicle would not steer, and i had to have my car towed home.     the next day i called ford to explained what happened and was told it would cost around $2,000 to fix. i googled it and found out the steering assist had been recalled for that year make and model.     i then called the number associated with the recall and keyed in the code related to the make and model. a few moments later, a rep came on the line and asked for my vin. he informed me that there was a recall in 2015 or 16 can't remember the exact year, but unfortunately, the recall was vin specific, and my vehicle was not on that list.    i found this news to be very disturbing, dangerous, and irresponsible for ford not to replace or repair this faulty part in all of the 2014 models, not just those with a specific vin.     what is it going to take for them to correct this; prayerfully not someone's life?"
"the automatic emergency braking system has malfunction many times - at least 10 times in the last year of ownership being january 2018 through november 2019.    the most recent specific incident occurred on november 22, 2019 at 12:20pm in clear daylight while driving on paved road, city street, not turning.    the rate of speed was approximately 15mph and caused the vehicle to immediately stop.     this is very concerning due to the high possibility of serious injury if the malfunction were to occur at a high rate of speed.

"recall alert: jaguar xffacebooktwitter  posted: december 9, 2008      jaguar is recalling about 3,800 2009 xf sedans due to an electrical defect that could result in a number of problems.  in a defect notice filed with the national highway traffic safety administration, jaguar explains, ""the instrument cluster speaker wires may fracture as a consequence of an overly aggressive tick-tock sound wave form, the volume of which is vehicle speed dependent."" the xf makes the tick-tock sound when its turn signal is engaged - and at high speed, the sound may be loud enough to crack the rubber coating on speaker wires.  ""in the event of a speaker failure, the following audible notifications will cease to function - directional indicators, seat belt warning, 'lights on' warning, driver's door open with the key in the ignition, driver intervention (adaptive cruise control equipped vehicles) and seat memory.""  dealers will make a simple software adjustment, free of charge, to fix the problem.  owners should receive a letter in the mail explaining the recall this week.  this is the second time the xf has been recalled since it came on the market just a few months ago.  the earlier recall, involving a seatbelt defect, was a far more serious safety risk - but the fact that the vehicle has been recalled twice in such a short time might concern some buyers.  the xf is a mechanically complex car with many features not found in other vehicles, from a shift knob that sits inside the console when the car is off and raises into the driver's hand after the vehicle is started, to a touch-sensitive glovebox lock.    jaguar has historically faced quality control problems.  the xf is a sharp-looking car with a powerful engine that has won praise from many reviewers, but quality problems with this car could defeat jaguar's efforts to reform its image.

"steering assist fault service required  i have a 2013 ford fusion and this light came on. i have lost any and all power to my steering. i can still drive it, but it is very hard to turn the wheel in any direction unless i give it gas. i called ford to see if this was under warranty, but they told me that they needed to look at it before they can tell if there were any recalls. they also charged me $150 and then proceeded to tell me that it needed $4396. half of that amount was to replace the rack & pinion. they never even told me if there were other recalls. after doing extensive research on the internet, i have seen many complaints about the ""steering assist fault"". i am 20 years old and i am in the navy stationed in norfolk, va. i bought the car in michigan so it has seen winters and salt from the roads. is the ford dealership that i took my car to trying to get out of taking care of the recall? i called my mother in laws mechanic and he told me that he could get all the parts for me himself for less then $800. but i have a $4300 bill?? i am on military pay, i don't have that kind of money!"

the collision mitigation braking system and adaptive cruise control system has thrown an error and stopped working 5 times now.  it has happened to me on long road trips on the highway at speeds of 50+ mph.  it has happened less than 30 minutes after starting the vehicle and sometimes after 2+ hours of driving.  the weather conditions have ranged from cloudy to fine (no snow or rain).  this is extremely dangerous to have happen at highway speeds in traffic.
as the driver was driving at various speeds the steering assist gave out both during  turns and on highway travel. no indication or warning was given and the car receives scheduled maintenance at ford dealerships. was diagnosed by a local mechanic that steering column needs to be replaced and that this model is not covered in the recent recall.
occasionally the power steering assist failure light would come on. i could kill the engine and restart it and it would return to working. however now the warning light is on and won't go off. the power steering will not work at all.
"on november 13, 2019 at 6:00pm pst while traveling 70mph westbound on interstate 90 at the sr18 interchange the vehicle experienced multiple serious safety defects and major systems failures due to loss of electrical power. light conditions were nighttime, traffic was light, weather was clear. electronic failure messages began to appear on instrumentation panel approximately 20 minutes prior to the total electrical failure:  navigation, stop/start, climate control, uconnect, sirius radio, adaptive cruise all ceased function with no driver ability to control these systems well prior to the total shutdown.  at total shutdown, with the vehicle still traveling at 70mph, the following additional events simultaneously occurred:  1.total failure and complete loss of power steering,  2.total failure and complete loss of power brakes,  3.total failure and complete loss of headlights, turn signals, and hazard lights  4.total failure and complete loss of all dashboard and u connect instrumentation,  5.total failure and complete loss of all steering column and dashpanel controls  6.total failure and complete loss of adaptive cruise control,  7.total failure and complete loss of electronic lane assist.  8.total failure and complete loss of electronic parking brake  this ended with the vehicle being safely pulled to the shoulder of the freeway. when stationary, the vehicle lost nearly all power; there was just enough remaining power to randomly illuminate displays and uconnect in arbitrary flashes; giving the dashpanel the appearance of a nightclub. the vehicle was then towed to the selling dealer."
"after just 23k miles, the brake pads, rotors, and tires all show overwear and will regularly need replacement about every 20-30k miles.  i have been advised that this is in part due to design of the chassis and, if used regularly, the adaptive cruise control.  volvo dealership says it is a regular complaint they see with the 2017 and newer models.  tire company (pirelli) says it is not the tires."
when stationary or in motion my daughter's 2012 kia soul makes a clicking noise  coming from what feels like in the steering wheel. after looking into this deeper it is the rubber coupler at the electric steering assist.  there are recalls for other years and models so both kia and hyundai both know of the problem but will not repair all vehicles. i hear it's an $8 part and $400 for labor through the dealer. what a great income stream for them!!

"nissan propilot has a serious safety flaw.  when using propilot on my 2018 nissan leaf sv in stop and go highway traffic, sometimes when my nissan leaf coasts to an almost complete stop 15 feet behind a ""boxy"" vehicle like a semi-truck, the leaf suddenly accelerates like if there is no vehicle directly in front of me and if i am not completely attentive and if i do not immediately apply the breaks, the nissan leaf would rear end the semi-truck.  this has happened to me 4 times over the past 6 months when following a semi-truck with trailer and this morning it occurred again a fifth time but this time i was behind a sedan.  i have a dashcam video of the incident from this morning.  i have reported this issue to nissan but they have done nothing about it.  i have taken my 2018 nissan leaf in to the local nissan service center but they say there is nothing wrong with the sensors and they do not see any issues and no error codes reported by the car.  i believe this is a software problem where the software ignores the radar image of the truck in front because it thinks it is an overhead sign and not another vehicle immediately in front, the camera input of the vehicle in front also appears to be ignored by the software in this situation.  additionally, i have had at least two incidents (also occurred  this morning) where propilot lane keeping feature shuts off and automatic emergency breaking is also shut off and deactivated for and extended period of time for now apparent reason (in excellent weather and clear conditions, no obstructions of sensors, etc.), i have video of this as well."

"we were driving a crv which is less than 6 months old. all of a sudden all safety systems failed. the breaks system, colliosion avoidence, lane assist, acc. all failed. fortunately we were at 20 mph so we were able to safely stop the crv. we towed the crv to the dealership and they after 4 days were able to figure out that all the safety systems had failed as there was an electrical shortcurcuit which has blown the fuses and the control system.  the cause of the electrical short was traced to exopsed wires in the rear view mirror assmebly which were damaged by an ornamnet we had hung.  the reason i am complaining is i want to bring it to your attention of this manufacturing defect.  1.lot of people hang ornamnets/ car freshner etc and this defect can cause a very serious system failure with all safety systems failing when the crv is in motion.  2.this crv is less than 6 m old so it also indicates to the poor designand manufacture .  3. crv is one of the most popular suvs sold in usa so lot of people are at risk.  4. the design engineer knew the importance of these wires so have a protective rubber insulation but the insulation leaves a gap where the wires are exposed, and can be damaged.  i have dramatic video showing this incident when we were drving and the exposed wires,  the short cricuit damage and the  ornament that they are blaming for this incident. i have the video that i could not load in this complain as the sytem would not allow it  to be loaded ,but i would be pleased to share if needed.

"vehicle is a 2012 ford focus with only 46,000 miles.  while starting to make a left turn from a stopped position the instrumentation panel showed a ""steering assist fault"" message and all power steering was lost.  this nearly resulted in hitting another vehicle as i was not prepared for the steering to become completely manual, it was difficult at such a slow speed to turn the wheel.   in speaking with ford this is a known issue, recall was issued for multiple vehicles and multiple years for the same issue but the focus was excluded."

"randomly the center counsel display will go blank as well as the driver's side display which contains the speedometer. also failing at the same time is the dvd player. we also experience a 'popping' noise through the speakers, even with audio system turned off. this usually is what happens first, then error messages (for example: 'radio unavailable', 'no audio connection for fm', 'network communication lost', 'check tuner'), then screen goes blank. when this happens while the driver is driving, they are unable to activate or deactivate specific safety controls including lane keep assist, cruise control, automatic braking etc. the automatic braking warning is also lost when the display goes out, as well as the speedometer. when this happens , both display screens turn off and go black, which are huge safety concerns. from the center display, we lose the back up camera, radio, navigation, dvd player and ability to make hands free phone calls among other things. this can occur daily, every time the car is driven, or sporatic and not happen for a few days at a time. car was purchased brand new in april 2019. problem began in the beginning of august 2019, exact date unknown. problems occur while the car is in motion or stationary, city streets, highway and at any speed and any time."
"car was stationary in my driveway..i started the car to pick up groceries, the power steering assist warning light came on. theres no power steering, having car towed to dealership. was informed my car cannot be serviced until dec 19 2019."
"i was driving on a busy street and the power steering quit working while maneuvering around some other driver,  and i almost got into an accident. it is very hard to steer now, i have checked the fuses and heard that ford's power steering assist is notorious for failing."
"while driving the car on both the highway and on city streets the steering locked and the power assist quit.  the mil traction control symbol lit and the warning center said it was disabled.  the mil steering assist control symbol lit and the warning center said it was disabled.  in both driving instances the steering wheel was being turned from moderate (interstate highway speed) turning to sharp turning (city street speed).  in both instances i was able to avoid hitting close, surrounding vehicles and in the case of the city occurrence, pedestrians.  in both instances i pulled the vehicle to the side of the road and shut off the engine and accessories.  i waited about a minute and performed an engine re-start.  the mil's were not lit and the power steering assist returned.  in both instances the same condition appeared about 20 minutes later, and a engine stop/re-start had to be performed.     i have included photos of the dashboard information center.    this is a 2016 fusion with 65,000 miles and i believe there is an electrical problem with the steering rack."
"tl* the contact owns a 2019 honda accord. on several occasions, while driving, the lane departure feature and automatic emergency braking system activated independently without a vehicle in close proximity. the vehicle was taken to metro honda in union county (4918 us-74, indian trail, nc 28079, (866) 756-8838) where it was diagnosed that the front camera and sensor needed to be replaced. the contact stated that the sensor and camera were replaced; however, the failure recurred. the manufacturer was informed of the failure. the approximate failure mileage was 1,000. the vin was invalid."
"driving the car normally at night the dashboard lights went to full intensity without driver input, and wouldn't change.  a few minutes later the rear windshield wiper started operating and wouldn't stop.  twenty minutes later the car flashed a notification that power steering assist was not functioning, and it became very difficult to steer.  the turn signals would not operate.  the low fuel warning indicator came on showed zero miles left even though there was at least a quarter tank left.  the speedometer readout changed to zero, while we were driving at about 35 mph.   we were able to safely stop the car at a convenience store / gas station.  the ignition switch wouldn't turn off the engine, the heat came on and wouldn't turn off, the windows wouldn't roll down, and the doors locked themselves.  the rear windshield washer continually pumped out fluid.  the front windshield wipers started and wouldn't turn off.  we called hertz and while we were on the phone with them the engine did shut down.    hertz sent a tow truck to retrieve the car.  when he arrived he called me to ask what the problem was with the car, as he found it to be operating normally."

"ford issued recall 15s18 for the power steering assist systems that shut down. in november i took my car into the local ford dealership for a different recall on an airbag.  i was informed of the above recall and stated at the time i didn't find it necessary, my car had high mileage and had never had any issues. i was informed that they had to perform the recall due to safety concerns.  two days later i took the car on a trip, at that time the power steering assist failed on the interstate.  i left the car at my mothers house and came back with my truck and trailer and towed it the 900 miles home.  i contacted ford and was told of an extension to the recall that was issued by ford when the compute update causes issues or fails.  i had my vehicle taken to the dealership that performed the power steering assist recall to start with and was informed that due to my mileage my car wasn't covered under the recall or extension, even though i didn't have any issues before they performed the recall.  the car is currently at mike raisor ford in lafayette indiana and the dealership not ford will cover the repairs under the recall or extension. apparently the dangerous recall is only dangerous under 150,000 miles.  after much reaseaech i have found the extension to this recall was issued because on half the vehicles the update was performed on the power steering assist failed after it was done.  ford wither needs to put an unlimited mileage/limitation on the extension to the recall or cap the recall at the same mileage as the extension.  by setting two different standards they are putting their customers at extended risk for dangerous driving or extremely costly repairs due to the issue with the repair work done under recall 15s18.  the attached document shows the original recall along with supplement 15n01"

"my wife and i were driving home on i35 in oklahoma.  the road was straight.  it was nighttime.  i had all the subaru eyesight safety systems enabled.  both hands were on the steering wheel, with adaptive cruise control set at 70mph.  lane centering was among the features operating.      i suddenly experienced an instantaneous and very abrupt, uncommanded ~30-40 degree clockwise rotation of the steering wheel.  the whole event lasted just 2-3 seconds and i quickly recovered back to the left.  fortunately, the lateral displacement of our track was only a few feet into the breakdown lane on the interstate.   my manual control inputs on the steering wheel easily overcame the actuator. i immediately disabled the lane centering function and we continued home without further incident.    the takeaway that i want to emphasize is that this was an extremely abrupt, sudden hard right deflection of the wheel.  this was not the normal gentle nudge and slow, slight steering wheel movements that the lane keep and lane centering systems normally provide.  imagine that your passenger reached over and forcefully grabbed the steering wheel and yanked hard down on it - that's as closely as i can describe this."
"2013 taurus w/ 82,000 mi -in my driveway, i turned on car, got the power steering assist light, and no steering control - doesn't turn either way.  there is a recall for this problem on the 2013 taurus, but not on my vin. i called ford 1-866-436-7332, was given a case number and  told to hold on to repair receipts in the case a new recall is issued and my vin is included. i'm not very  hopeful i will ever get reimbursed.  i haven't repaired it yet, but will have to since i need my car.  i'm terrified of the cost to repair."
adaptive cruise control which controls vehicle speed to ensure safe distance stopped working rendering cruise control inoperable. this also caused the forward crash avoidance to not work.  vehicle trouble code uo269-00 stored which resulted in replacing long range radar module to correct for $1055.00  
"2019 rogue emergency braking system has triggered automatically for no reason.  normal travel speeds (apx 30mph) no dangers in front of vehicle but ebs triggered and abruptly brought vehicle to stop.   brought the car into nissain dealer, who ""updated software"" and had same issue with system triggering a couple of weeks later.   brought back to nissain who replaced the radar system, but after a week or two, the dashboard  light signaling there was something wrong with the system began to blink again every time the vehicle was turned on."
"in three separate occasions since purchase january 16th, 2018, the adaptive cruise control has lost track of an suv in front of me and continued to accelerate. driver had to intervene. first instance was a brown pontiac aztec in clear weather daytime. second occurrence was a blue chevy encore in clear weather daytime. third occurrence was a black escalade in clear weather at night.     vehicle cruise control was set to 70-80 mph with the closest distance setting."
the automatic emergency braking system on my 2017 rogue engaged yesterday during highway driving at roughly 60 mph.  what a horrifically terrifying event.  i was traveling within a single lane on a 3 lane highway when out of the blue the brakes locked up.  the vehicle shuddered and the car went from 60 mph to about 15-20 mph in a matter of a couple hundred feet.  it felt as though several tires had blown out at once or the automatic transmission had completely locked up.  i remember hearing an audible chime and seeing something on the console panel flashing what i believe to be red warning light while i was fighting to retain control of the vehicle.  within a period of about 3-5 seconds the whole event was over and the vehicle had abruptly slowed itself to the aforementioned speed.  fortunately at the time the traffic was light and there was not another vehicle directly behind me or the consequences of this event would have ended tragically.  the important thing to note is that this was relatively open road at the time and there were no other vehicles or obstructions in front or to the sides of the vehicle when this occurred. the vehicle has been promptly turned over to nissan for a full review and repair of the forward emergency braking system.

while driving vehicle power steering assist quit on multiple occasions. this was corrected temporarily after shutting vehicle off and restarting it. i had at least a dozen episodes of this and it appears to be happening more frequently.this would occur at times when first attempting to drive and after i had slowed down to make a turn. i have not noticed it while at idle. i am concerned of this preventing me from steering in a critical situation. i am trying to use this car as least as possible until it is corrected.

"during normal driving in town and on highway, stabillitrak deactivates, power steering assist deactivates and the steering becomes very difficult, airbags deactivate, turn signals become inoperable, radio shuts off, air conditioning shuts off. this happens while at speed on the highway and at slow speeds. it is especially dangerous when making slow turns as the power steering gives out and the truck instantly becomes nearly uncontrollable (uncontrollable for my wife) in the middle of the turn. i have taken the truck to the dealership and they said nothing is wrong and the best they could do was perform a service bulletin. issue was not corrected. i found that there was a new bulletin that had a fix for the g218 ground. i cut back the sound deadening from the ground, yet that did not fix the issue either. the truck has done this dozens of times and is incredibly unsafe to drive. how can losing steering, airbags, stability control, turn signals, etc. not be a safety concern?"
"while drivind on autopilot , the car is changing from drive to park mode.it happened many times on freeway.service center unable to resolve the issue"
"the truck will display a warning on the dash as well as make audible warnings saying that a camera in the grille is blocked or malfunctioning. another warning that also happens a lot is something saying that a crash has been detected, it has loud chimes that go off as well as a flashing red display on dash. the pre collision warning also frequently alerts with visual and audible warnings. all of these will happen at any random time, and of all the couple dozen times these warnings have happened there hasn't been a single time that there was any traffic nearby, nor was there anything blocking any camera or sensor. the vehicle is barely more than a month old and has been back to the dealership a few times to fix body alignment issues and programming issues with the ecu, pcm and tcu. the service department told me that the pre collision system only works if you also have adaptive cruise control, which my truck does not. they said there is no way to fix the system to get it to stop giving false warnings unless they add the adaptive cruise control module and other components. however, the dealership is refusing to add the additional parts and also refusing to replace the vehicle with one that does. they told me ford is aware of this issue, and admits that a false warning may activate the braking system on its own, which can cause an accident, but they stated that ford will not pay correct the issue.   this is a serious safety issue and ford needs to issue a recall for their faulty, and dangerous, collision warning system. they need to install adaptive cruise control in vehicles without if that's all it would take to fix the issue and make vehicles safe to drive."
car was parked when i started it up. i got a steering assist fault message. guess it's a common problem with ford's epas. they should be held accountable like takata because of the huge safety risk. according to ford my vin isn't part of the recall for the same model and year. ridiculous.

"automatic emergency braking system sensor frequently lights up with a warning radar unavailable while driving on the highway and local streets. i just got this car and after one day i had to take it back to the dealer. first they said they would replace the sensor. after four days in the shop they said they cleaned the sensor and cleared the codes. they also calibrated the sensor. the next day it happened again twice. i have an appointment to take it back to the dealer in two days. in reading the nhtsa website there are many reports of this problem with this year and model car, with the forward collision avoidance system. many owners have reported this issue. nissan has failed to issue a recall or fix the problem. these cars are lemons. the failure can cause an accident or something a lot more serious. action needs to be taken."

here is a tesla model s in the junkyard.  there is hardly any impact damage to the bodywork. no air-bags have been deployed.  the cast alloy steering knuckle has cracked in half.  the only possible way for that to happen is if there is a casting flaw during manufacture.  this is a heavy high performance car that is frequently driven hands free on so called autopilot. having such badly made weak suspension parts only adds to the danger.  will you please investigate this case and that of so many other tesla suspension failures.  thank you.  keef
driving in a strip mall the steering locked up and a code stating power steering assist fault warning came on. i had to forcefully steer into a parking space to get out of the way from thru traffic. i turned off the engine and restarted the truck and it reset the warning. i was able to drive to an o'reillys where they were not able to help me. the steering locked up again at o'reillys. i had to call a nephew to help me with truck to a shop to see what the problem was. three same code came on. there should be a recall for this issue. it is very dangerous.

after starting my truck i got the following messages  service esc  service trailer brake  brake system failure - 62 mph top speed  steering assist reduced drive with care  thought i would just limp it home although after leaving my parking spot i realized that i had almost no brakes at a all. i re parked the truck and had it towed to the dealership which is telling me that they reset the codes but that there is a possibility of it happening again. no brakes at highway speeds would be disastrous!
"this is the 2nd time this has happened.  once in 2018 approx feb.  the steering lost all electric assist. this always appeared after it was driven and had been parked. it did this about 4 times before the dealer would repair it.  at that time everything was covered by warranty.  this time, the same problem, loss of all steering assist after driving and it was parked.  same issue, this time they tell me the steering gear box needs to be replaced at a cost of over $2000.00.  exactly the same issue the 2015 was having.  i have read the complaints and i fear this will happen at highway speed.  we live in an extreme cold climate at times and both instances my vehicle was parked after driving in -20f weather."
"automatic emergency braking system has serious issues that nissan knows about but can't fix. warning lights on dash come on at random times, both solidly out and flashing, and even worse, at times with no other cars on the highway, the vehicle decides to slam on the brakes. very dangerous.  all the dealer can say is we checked the car and no codes were found, yet there are multiple complaints about this and two class action lawsuits. same thing happens at random times when backing out of my driveway. different system in the car but same result - car brakes for no reason - nothing behind me, no obstructions. not quite as serious as the front emergency brakes not working but still an issue. this has happened multiple times but i entered today's date as today was the latest occurrence."

"i have had multiple instances where several system alerts pop up on my dashboard for no apparent reason (lane keeping assist problem, road departure mitigation system problem, adaptive cruise control problem, collision mitigation system problem, and brake system light). this has happened intermittently since i first owned my brand new car (the first time it happened was one month after owning it). i have taken it to my dealer several times and they have tried various things, but honda has yet to come up with a proper solution. this has happened both when turning my car on, as well as when i'm driving."

"dear sir or madam,    i leased a new mazda 3 on 12/20/2019. at the time of signing all documents i was provided with a document to sign that the dealership were not allowed to sell me a car with an open recall. after registering with the mazda app i found out that there is an open recall. is this legal and what are my rights? this seems extremely dishonest. i would appreciate your feedback and advice on what i can do in this situation.    the vehicle may unexpectedly stop while driving due to inadvertent activation of the smart braking system (sbs) automatic emergency braking system.    many thanks"
"i was driving back from grocery shopping when i lost control over steering. the moment when i lost control was during my slight right turn moving at speed of about 30mph i did not know what happened at the moment because i was more focused to not hit anyone presenr at that moment on the road. good thing is that school across the road was closed because timing when this happen was around the time when parents usually pick their kids for school. after i parked car i investigate to see what had happen. there were three messages indicating that something was wrong: 1. steering assist fault - service required, 2. service advancetrac and 3. hill start assist not available. i was searching today to see other people experiance and results were positive a lot of cases like this one. things that all reports have in common is that all owners needed to pay to fix car no option for recal. eventhough that models like this one used to have several things that needed to be changed on similat things in the past."
"power steering locks up, messege of poweer steering assist comes up on dasboatd"
"i was on the highway on the interior lane at 75 mph when all the sudden i got a audible and visual alarm indicating steering failure.  i then got the same for stabiltrak failure. the steering assist was obviously gone immediately and the car started floating back and forth.    i had my wife and 92 year old mother-in -law with me and it was misting heavily so i carefully continued to drive at a reduced speed.  i took the car in and they said the steering was not getting electricity.  also, they said the passenger side rear wheel sensor went out which caused the back and forth motion.  the car dealership wants to charge me $3400 for the repairs.  i see that there were recalls on other gm products for the steering on similar models i.e. cadillac etc.  i found several instances online for buick lacrosse but for some reason not all were reported.  i bought this certified vehicle may 2018 with 19,520 mi. which is at around 42,500 mi. now.    i am very concerned about the safety of this product in the future and would like for n.h.t.s.a to take another look at this steering issue and why these two issues with the sensor and the steering occurring at the same time."
"my 2018 subaru outback does not have steering assist and was purchased new.  at all speeds, the steering feels very loose when traveling resulting in a disconnect between the road/wheels and the steering wheel.  at highway speeds, the car often feels like it is hydroplaning or wind is forcing it to the left or right despite driving on dry roads in calm weather. the steering is erratic and is especially unpredictable when driving on uneven or snow covered roads.  on snowy roads, the car drifts and feels like it is uncontrollably starting to slide resulting in an over correction of the steering wheel.  this problem is terrifying and the exact opposite of how subaru advertises the car performance.  i took the car to my dealer as it is still under warranty and they only said it was the alignment which we just had done the previous week.  subaru has had steering problems before and i feel like they are just trying to ignore the problem.  im surprised they have not issued a recall since the problem is very dangerous and could result in driving accidents and deaths."
when i was driving the power steering failed almost causing me to hit another vehicle while turning the corner onto a city street. a light in the vehicle came on and stated power steering assist fault.
two times in the past week my power steering assist fault has popped up on my dashboard and my steering wheel has been locked up. after turning it off and leaving it for a few hours and trying again it's fine like it never happened. but being it is electrical i can not just put fluid in it. this issue concerns me because i do not know if i will be driving down a highway and all of a sudden it will pop up and lock my steering up or i will be stranded somewhere. since it just pops up and goes away eventually this is a major issue!
"within 1 year i bought brand new hybrid malibu car from chevy dealer, i had experienced dead 12v battery. dealer replaced the battery which i paid even though i thought it should be within warranty. last night i experienced 3rd dead battery again after i parked the car for 7 hrs office work. the 2nd time dead battery occured was last june 2019 only, dealer also replaced the battry. its a 3rd time that i experience dead battery (stationary/parked) for brand new car 2017 hybrid malibu within 2 years. obviously its not the battery issue but its design of electrical system. before and during the battery issue, i got stabilitrak light on and steering assist in reduced alarm as well. i just want to vent my frustation with this brand new car. hope other car owners will benefit from this info.    for 10 years i never had battry issue on my previous car.   thanks"
i keep getting power steering assist fault errors.  it seems to me that this should have been fixed by a recall.
"tl* the contact's girlfriend owns a 2015 ram 1500. while driving various speeds, the power assist failed to operate without warning. the contact stated that the power assist would only  operate intermittently. the contact took the vehicle to lafontaine chrysler dodge jeep ram of clinton (1111 w michigan ave, clinton, mi 49236) where it was diagnosed that the power steering assist was faulty. the manufacturer was notified and stated that the vin was not included in a recall. the contact associated the failure with nhtsa campaign number: 16v167000 (steering). the vehicle was not repaired. the failure mileage was approximately 50,000.

"new truck, gmc 1500 denali, 1100 miles, started vehicle with multiple warning sounds & warning lights, dash says ""brake system failure 62mph top speed"", service trailer brake system"", steering assist is reduced drive with care"" service esc"", braking was completely reduced  & needed hard press on brake to try and get vehicle to stop. very diminished braking.   vehicle was stationary in a parking lot when this happened on restart."
"i had a recall performed at a dealership and they confirmed the vehicle is running properly.  i noticed that the next day my lane keep assist was turned off and not functioning.  later that same day when approaching a stop sign, i noticed that 4 warning messages appeared on my dash.  the first said power steering assist disable, the next service esc, the next trailer brake disabled, the next vehicle limited to 62mph."
my 2010 ford fusion steering keeps locking up with a steering assist fault code. it happens at random times wether at slow speeds or high speeds. my daughter drives this vehicle and it's very scary to think she will lose control of a moving vehicle putting her in danger and others around her. i've noticed there have been thousands of complaints but ford refuses to recall the 2010 year. they have recalled other years for this problem. i just don't understand.
"here is a description of the safety issues this car continues to have that the manufacturer and two dealers will not fix under the manufacturer's warrantee because they claim they can not duplicate and there are no stored error codes.  this car has a lane departure mitigation (ldm) system that has falsely activated many times while the car is centered on the driving lane.  the ldm activates by providing a warning on the dashboard and by moving the steering wheel quickly to the left and to the right which distracts the driver (a safety issue) and once caused me to almost steer the car into a semi on my right by compensating for the left steering wheel movement.  this car also has a lane keep assist system (lkas) which repeatedly has steered the car off the road. both these issues have been recorded and provided to ahm and both dealers.  these issues happen randomly on city streets and highways.  additionally, this car has issues with randomly displaying an incorrect speed limit on the dashboard (100 mph in a 60 mph zone), falsely warning ""steering is required"" on the dashboard, a ""shift to park"" warning while repositioning the car and the engine is on, and the brake assist/anti-collision falsely activating when nothing is directly in the path of the car.  all of these happen while the car is operating on city streets and highways."
came out from shopping on 12-26-19 went to leave when all of a sudden the   power steering assist fault light came on and it became extremely hard to steer. took to mechanic told me its the rack pinion which is going to cost over $2000 to fix . and then i see its a known ford problem.   i do see that there is an open investigation with several complaints
"abrupt automatic unwarranted braking occurred in two incidents while travelling on boulevard.   weather was clear, there were no vehicles in front (and fortunately none behind) when the automatic braking system engaged.   did not bring vehicle to complete stop but the brakes were automatically applied and abrupt slowing down of vehicle occurred.   this braking system did work properly in at least two other conditions - ie driving into interior home garage.  unexpected automatic emergency braking while driving with no obvious obstacles (ie vehicles, road debris) is dangerous."
"starting vehicle, power steering assist fault displayed and steering wheel would not turn.  turned off ignition. waited a minute and restarted. condition disappeared. fearful of driving vehicle as i now read this fault has occurred to others while driving on highway at excelereated speeds. i can definitely see this could be a deadly situation if it occurs again while in motion.  also see other years of fusions recalled for this fault. it is concerning this 2010 isn't on a recall for this fault."
"forward emergency braking (feb) system warning light issue and car  is slamming on the brakes, even when there are no obstacles around:  1.  driving at 65mph, light started blinking, no other observed problems.  car / all sensors were clean, no obstacles.  2.  after driving further (about 15 minutes) light went off by itself.  3.  on a return trip the next day, while driving at 75mph, no traffic in front or rear of car, and, cruise control set, car suddenly and violently felt like someone hit the brakes.  we went from 75 to 40 very quickly.  no indicators on the dash were lit. this could have been fatal if someone had been behind us, because when this happens, the brakes light do not engage.  this is a serious safety issue, that needs to be addressed, or the car bought back.  it is no longer just a safety feature, but, could lead to death on the highway if this system acts up and stops the car without warning or even brake lights."
"the vehicle was stationary, when i went to turn it on it had a power steering assist fault. ended up having to take it into the dealership who are working on it right now. total cost of the work is about $1,800 and looking online it's obvious many others have had this issue. when i brought up the recall on 2010 ford fusions (recall 15s18) i was told that only applied to cars built in september of 2010 to another date, when mine was build in june - meaning it didn't qualify. it is my belief that this should  be included in the recall by ford as many others have had the same issue."
steering becomes difficult while driving the vehicle in cold weather. vehicle was allowed to warm up for approximately 10 minutes before being driven on city streets as well as highway. all forms of turning the wheel (either turning onto a different street in the city or a lane change on the highway) were difficult to do due to a lack of assistance from the electronic steering assist system.
"since i have leased the vehicle, the collision mitigation breaking system is coming on when not needed, at times during highway speeds.. i have been nearly rear-ended three times, the latest causing the man behind me to almost go off the road into a ditch (thankfully he was able to just barely avoid this) and it is happening when my husband is driving the car as well. it is very startling and worrisome. the car actually nosedives and comes to a complete stop at times'other times it breaks suddenly and then releases or i have to put my foot down on the gas while trying to disengage the system. i have taken it into the dealership a few times already and they are not able to fix it as it cannot be replicated when they have had it (weeks can go by in between when it happens) and i have expressed i do not want them constantly driving my vehicle trying to cause this issue when i was told explicitly that if this happens and they're driving my vehicle, my insurance is responsible. i have also filed a complaint with honda motor america where a case has been opened and closed very quickly. their response was that it is pretty much not their problem, i am on my own unless i am able to make it happen in front of an advisor, or have an advisor drive my car frequently (like using it to go to and from work, etc. being they do not drive it far when trying to replicate the issue) and they do not hold any liability if this issue is to cause an accident where myself or other drivers on the work are injured in any capacity. i also have been getting warning lights at times that the system is malfunctioning and my automatic high beams have begun to not work properly as well. the dealer told me the only fix is to 'if i were you i would just shut it off every time i get in the car'. i want it to work properly being it was part of the reason i leased the vehicle as it's standard equipment,"
while driving some times on the highway and sometimes when driving slow in the city i lost power steering assist and had to shift to neutral and turn engine off and restart engine again to have power steering working again.  have been happening intermittently.
"tl* the contact owns a 2015 ford edge. while attempting to accelerate from a stop, the steering wheel became firm. the contact stated that additional effort was needed to maneuver the vehicle. the vehicle was taken to suburban ford of waterford (6975 highland rd, waterford twp, mi 48327, (248) 674-4781) where it was diagnosed that the steering gear bolt detached, which caused a loss of power steering assist. the vehicle was not repaired. the vehicle was included in nhtsa campaign number: 19v632000 (steering). the manufacturer was not notified of the failure. the approximate failure mileage was 90,000.

"tl* the contact owns a 2019 gmc sierra 1500. while driving approximately 25 mph and attempting to brake, the brake pedal traveled all the way to the floorboard. also, the abs, check engine, brake, and differential warning indicators illuminated. in addition, the service trailer brake system, service esc, steering assist reduced, drive with care and brake system failure system top speed 62 mph messages appeared on the message board. the vehicle was towed to ingersoll auto of danbury (84 federal rd, danbury, ct 06810). the same dealer repaired the vehicle on december 28, 2019 per nhtsa campaign numbers: 19v814000 (seat belts) and 19v889000 (service brakes, hydraulic, electronic stability control, service brakes). the manufacturer was not notified of the failure. the vehicle was not repaired. the approximate failure mileage was 2,606.
