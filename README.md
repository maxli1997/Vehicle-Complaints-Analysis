This study 

1) investigated the limitations and solutions of ADAS through a literature review,

2) identified the causes and effects of ADAS through consumer complaints using natural language processing models, and

3) compared the major differences between the two.

These two lines of research identified similar categories of ADAS causes, including human factors, environmental factors, and vehicle factors. However, academic research focused more on human factors of ADAS issues and proposed advanced algorithms to mitigate such issues while drivers complained more of vehicle factors of ADAS failures, which led to associated top consequences.
